 Post some stuff off!!
 Need a spam bot
 Perfect time to start researching how to spam on WhatsApp lmao
 Yes I'll see online if I can find anything regarding secondary WhatsApp bot stuff
 Ok sounds good, I'll hit it up as well
 ✌
 Also as a secondary utility we could rank the most used emojis; this is my favourite one 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
 I'll end all my sentences with that 👌🏽
 So make sure to use 👍🏽 emojis 😏😏 frequently 👌🏽
 Maybe insert a few as noise in your text 👌🏽
 Sure...I'll do some of these✌
 Cool ✌
 Hey can you remove the emoji from group title and add some unique number sequence instead?
 👌🏽
 Done
 Why though ✌
 Is the emoji in the title affecting the text file
 No I just realised if we are to use scripts, then we may need to have the group title as something typable👌🏽
 And the number sequence just because 👌🏽
 Yeah cool ✌
 I'll be working on the code tomorrow hopefully
 Outside now ✌
 Ok cool 👌🏽
 ... On second thoughts it's against WhatsApp TOS to automate message-sending. I don't wanna get banned and neither do you 😅. We'll stick to brute messaging👌🏽
