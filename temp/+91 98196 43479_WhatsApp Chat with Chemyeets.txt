But what about the life skills class
You can't move that
If there were more than one class per week, bunking one would be fine
Guys sitting in 201 are Batch 4
202 guys are Batch 5
Just remember it like that
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
There won't be Phy lecture on that day
So mini test won't be possible on quiz day
Slots get switched
Thermo guy can't afford to lose his slot on that day
The same thing's happening in one of my friend's college
This shit is getting famous now
I guess it's not my friend's college
Didn't we already have a discussion on that in class?
That day when Gautam asked of he should ask the profs

Happy birthday!
Yeah
There's no error because your extra inputs are stored in the next memory locations
C doesn't check array bounds
The call a[I] is just a pointer
It's not supposed to
If it contains some program memory, then your program will show errors
Else it will run like normal
Basically the extra assignment will overwrite whatever was there in those locations
Declaration reserves a set of continuous memory locations for the array
The locations after that can be used the computer to store program memory
If you overwrite those addresses, you are corrupting the program
That's why you need bounds
The compiler expects you to stick to your bounds
If you don't it's your fault
Class
Same as quizzes bro
Happy birthday Anna!
Wait for second round
