Producing music out of thin air, making water dance to your wish, making your own laser show, getting projects patented and breaking Guinness, limca records...just another normal day for an Envisage coordinator. Envisage is India's *first* and *only* student run techno-entertainment show, and also presents an exhibition of interactive projects where coordinators get to present their projects to thousands of people. If you love Technology and would like to have some fun creating fun projects, then Envisage is the right place for you. Do attend the fundae session at *Himalaya lawns* at *9:00 PM tonight (Thursday)* to know more about Team Envisage. Join this WhatsApp group to get timely updates!
