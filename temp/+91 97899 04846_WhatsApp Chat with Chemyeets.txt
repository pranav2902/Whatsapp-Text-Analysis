The above core positions are yet to be filled. If you are interested in any of the above groups, please do join. The work is not much for any of the above teams. If you want to know more about any of the working and schedule of the teams, drop me a message and we can talk about it
You guys would be aware at this point that things were not in the best shape last year for ChES but I request you to not judge ChES on what you saw in one or the previous years. We can be better, maybe even the best ever. It's all in the hands of the upcoming cores. Please join ChES and keep up the enthu till the end.
