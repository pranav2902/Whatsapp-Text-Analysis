The 2nd class committee is today @ 5pm...it's apparently to discuss about performance in quiz 1 ...so do give your opinion about the difficulty level of the quiz held
These are the average marks in quiz 1 for the entire course:
Cs 15.7
Ma 11.2
Phy 10.27
They told there r many who scored below 30% in math (all the batches) though two questions were directly from the assignment...they r not ready to upload solution for the assignments..kindly do pay attention atleast during tutorials as even in upcoming exams tt questions will have good amount of weightage
Book is not mine...it's sathya's
