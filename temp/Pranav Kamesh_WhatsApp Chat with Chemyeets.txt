Hey guys, 
Ignite is a 3 months program conducted by American Express, where you can propose projects related to any domain, but the solution of the problem should be related to AI and data science. Based on the idea potential, Amex will shortlist a few projects and provide mentorship + Financial support till project completion.
This week American Express will conduct a webinar session to discuss how exactly the program is going to be executed. This will be a zoom webinar, so you can join from anywhere. 

The webinar date will be announced soon.
