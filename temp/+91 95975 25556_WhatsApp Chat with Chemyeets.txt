*Hello friends, Let us MESS IT UP!* 
Fill this form or read below and fill this form.

Can you introspect on how much is it that you on an average spend per week ordering meal online? Rupees 300, 500, 1000, or more than that. Well, you know your number! Or worse, just skipped the meal. 

Now, what I want you to ponder on is how many among these times you had to order/skip because 

*a)*	Waking up on an alarm was only possible if someone told me it was ringing. Duh!
*b)*	You missed the MESS meal because your favourite show made you lose track of time
*c)*	Walking to the MESS was just like losing your arm and leg
*d)*	Succumbing to the peer pressure as none of my friends were going
*e)*	I had my classes/lab and couldn’t risk the W.
*f)* Food is not good.

*Please fill the form*
