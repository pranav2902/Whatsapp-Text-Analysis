Listen guys. During Dussehra, we can get one more day vacation
You guys want in?
I uploaded it 😒
That's it
That's the assignment
We got only one for Inorganic
You got one and yet you're asking which one? -.-
Yes Thursday
We have to prepone or postpone 3 classes
I want that too. We'll shift it to Wednesday
Can't shift that
I'll skip one class
Won't matter much in attendance
I don't think that'd be easy
Thursday would be easier
As Friday's timetable will be followed
Yes
Professors
Lakshita doesn't
She told this in from of sir
So I take it most people want a holiday in Thursday
Now
Divika shut up
We'll come to your topic later
28th
September
So final?
Dussehra
Now since I've made it clear, should I vouch for Thursday?
Life skills bunk
The only problem about Tuesday is lab. If we want a holiday on Tuesday, we'll have to cancel the lab. No other option
If you want to attend, you attend. No one is forcing you
Most people in my wing are in support of Lakshita
But they have adjusted that way only na
We can take one holiday if we have 8 classes
😂😂
*Shounak
How are you still on this planet?
No
Dussrehra
Mostly everyone is in support
Life skills 😑
Seriously
Exactly
We did
I wrote on the board
Shift to?
2-3 is fine?
Okay. We'll do that

Greetings Freshies!

Many of you would have been fascinated by the *holographic* displays that appeared in *Iron Man*’s suit and Princess Leia’s messages in *Star Wars*. Ever wondered about the technology behind holograms? Have you dreamt of *creating your own holograms*? 

If the answer is yes, then we have something in store for you! Shaastra 2018, presents its first event - *Technovision: A peek into the future.* Get ready for a hands-on experience with holograms and gear up to escape to a world of your imagination! 

Exciting *goodies* and *headphones* up for grabs!

*Date*    21/08/17
*Venue* SAC, Middle Earth
*Time*   6:00 pm
Seems like someone is still in 2011 😏
Chem, maths, mech. Ch17b028
Guys ME1100 we can self enrol
No enrolment key is required
Guys we can go individually
Or we can send the guy an email and he'll do it for us
So that day in the CR meeting, they asked us to email him an Excel spreadsheet with all those roll numbers who need to be enrolled
Simran is doing that. I don't have a laptop
Or else Rithika will
@918527116597
First of all, can we fix the slot of 10-11 for physical chemistry this Wednesday?
Only for batch 4
Bey ladki hai woh 😂
He asked us to get him an alternate slot as his class wasn't there this Friday
He did. Today
That's when he asked for the CR
He didn't? 😏
November? Or September?
Send him the invite
https://chat.whatsapp.com/AJXJesHxMvOGxxjm2igcuK
Sending the notes again for those who didn't check on Friday
No problem
Quiz 1 schedule
These are the physical chemistry notes
And guys when should we keep the rescheduled class in September?
27 September (wed) 10-11?
We can keep it on 4th October
Okay
So 4th October, guys?
I have to send the mail
4
I think it'd be better if they team up and talk to the prof about it
Not a good idea.

Hey all,

Today, the 27th of October, LitSoc brings to you its next event - What's The Good Word.

Dialogues, autopsies, obituaries, education- did you notice those four words had all five vowels in them? Eda, did you realize Idnih, Limat, Ugulet, Adannak and Hsilgne do not make sense, while Malayalam does? Tom Marvolo Riddle ---> I am Lord Voldemort?

How quickly can you find out what is so unusual about this paragraph? It looks so ordinary that you would think that nothing is wrong with it at all, and, in fact, nothing is. But it is unusual. Why?

Words are fun things. WTGW is a badass fun event involving those fun things. So grab a friend and come along for a night with words.

VENUE: MSB 242
DATE: Oct 27th, 2017 (Friday)
TIME: 7:00 pm

It's a team of 2 event. And there is limit on no.of teams per hostel, how many ever teams can go!

Interested people contact me (9566336037)

Hello chem junta!
I am the technical affairs secretary of Brahmaputra.
I wanted to let you guys know about the tech-soc event which is going to happen to come today!!!(I know it sounds wierd that there is no prior information about this😞but couldn't help it.)
All the coding enthu junta give it a try,you have already received a smail about the event.It is an online event which you can access from your rooms😃 and  it is going to happen from 4pm - 7pm.

I won't lie saying the pre-requisites needed is *only* enthu, decent programming skills in any of the programming languages is fine😉
Spread the word guys🤝🏻

Go brahms💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
There is a website called codechef in which u need to create an account and fill that username in the circulated Google form
Can't decide if actual mail or fake
Sometimes, the joke's on us ourselves :(
AFAIK, no
Lol chillz
🔥🔥🔥
Regarding the CS mail, I'll make it clear. *It's NOT a class.* It's about instruction hours.
🌚
Gg
Dude, BITS Pilani
Happy birthday
Sir is taking class
No proxies possible
Reminder. Tomorrow CH1020 extra class. Attendance will be taken
From 2
Idk how long it'll last
Should be for 50 minutes
@919940336837 for AAS
Class.
It's yet another version of loss
Yes
No. Prof is here
Press F for respect 
Ffffffff
*Tomorrow CH1020 Tutorial*. Whoever has F&R, please bring. And don't forget your calculator and notebook.
We don't?
WTF? No
He'll take attendance
He's use the attendance of extra classes if someone has low attendance
Nope
Tomorrow no class.
PS- He didn't tell me. He told Divika. Agar attendance gaya toh usko peetna

Hello all!
Greetings from Career Development Cell (CDC), IAR Student Council!
We are organizing a lecture in collaboration with Vision IAS for aspirants of the UPSC examination. We would be organizing a lecture by S Vanadana Raj IRS(CCE) from New Delhi to clear doubts in the minds of the aspirants and lay a path to success.
Date: 20th April, 2018 (Friday)
Venue: ICSR Auditorium 
Time: 6:30 pm
*Aaryaan
Reminder:
Assignment submission is tomorrow 5 pm
*Important* 
If anyone has backlog in the Maths course we did in *first sem*, please let me know. 

If there are many people we can arrange for them to clear the course in summer as this facility is available for maths.
He taught psychometric chart in last class, didn't he?
I have no idea
*Shounak
Tomorrow he'll give
Okay wait
I am forwarding your email to the HoD as he is the one who has to make the decision on this
commitment keeping everything in mind. 

As you know, one section of ME1100 is currently (and always) being offered. Thirty eight
backlog students are registered. It is being taught outside the regular hours to facilitate
students who may have clashes within the regular slot hours. The course is offered during both
semesters in an academic year. Hence there is no ground for offering it during the summer
also. In addition, faculty members have to perform a lot of administrative and academic
work during the summer. For instance : selection of MS/PhD students, recruitment of new
faculty, BTech/DD/MTech viva, MS/PhD viva voce, summer internship programs, just to name
a few. 

While I understand the students' anxiety to complete the course, I also want you to understand
that the ME dept is doing more than what can reasonably be expected from such a big 
department.

Dude half of your information is based on half knowledge. Its like 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
First get every fact correct. Then come have a debate. We'd be happy to learn something or even counter some views. Until then keep your illiterate narcissistic ideas to yourself
No but next time onwards when people are telling you stuff, stop for a moment and think if they have a point or not. Today Raj and Sriram had a point but you were more into proving your point.
Your point may or may not be correct. That's not the issue. The issue is that when someone mentions something which does make sense, you don't even listen
Great. One more salty person to deal with. What a time to be online
*Shounak
Yeah. Atleast you wouldn't have failed in English o level
Also I don't want to know if you're sarcastic or not, which you are of course. You should check all sources before citing them. Most newspapers report with changes. There was an article on 2 AIs discovering a different language to communicate which was covered wrongly by the newspapers. Do cross check your views
Because I read all sources about tricky issues
CNN, BBC, local news channels
You can never be sure which newspaper or sites to trust
I don't trust any
What?
I read the sites
.
Can't help if you misread
But it has the video of an outsider
To form a decision you need to check all sides
Everyone takes some data from everyone. But they are biased against something or someone
BBC and CNN are biased against Middle East. So you need to know the local story
Did you even listen to what Raj and Sriram wrote?
*read what
Do you think they have a point?
I'm not one to decide, you are
Also this is why I called you narcissistic
Illiterate was an additional insult.
I never said anything about you not having a point
Did I?
You're the one assuming that
I do think you have a point but they do too. The views on such matters are multifaceted. There are a lot of statistics and issues. You can generalie things
"Every"
*can't generalize
I haven't
I told you some of what you said are wrong
They are generalized
So where is the video from?
I'm not countering you. I'm merely telling you they are right.
I'll give an example. You'll understand
Sunn le
Fir bolna
Again this. I told you some of them are wrong
Video ke sources bol
Pehle yeh?
It's all logicsl
*logical
Fine. Don't accept it.
It's pretty true
Alright
Is that a threat?
Or a warning?
Because I don't care
Let's not talk about your upbringing here. People here don't like obscenities
@919636219616 @917738346746
I tagged them
I didn't tell they are my sources
I do. But you won't listen to my logic.
And you were the one who said there's no point in discussing it with me
I am noy
*not
You aren't listening to me
Yes. But I don't want to further continue talking on this
That's why I tagged them
Hopefully they have the patience to deal with you
I don't
Patience
Implying things doesn't make them true
That's what you're doing and have been doing till now
I didn't imply. I called you. You are one.
From where?
Sources kya hai?
Credible hai? Nahi. Palestine wale ne likha hai.
Yeah right. They are biased
You're generalizing stuff. They are specific

But converged at 1.3 and the previous x was 1.4. And the root is ~1.4
What? Why?
I calculated the value of the entire thing and rounded it off to two significant figures

Hello,


Diffusion and Fick's law are deceptively simple.  Be careful in defining the appropriate form of Fick's law.  Mass fraction gradient drives diffusion while density gradient caused by temperature differences drive natural convection and the latter is not described by Fick's law.  So mass fraction gradient is more fundamental.  

Also volume averaged velocity is better than mass/molar average velocity.  This is based on partial molar properties (V_1Bar * N_1+V_2bar*N_2) and explicitly defined on concentration gradient.    

We cannot always assume constant total concentration and take rho_t or C_t within the gradient in Fick's law based on mass fraction or mole fraction driving forces.   

So exercise Fick's law with caution.


In the fundamental form, Fick's diffusion coefficients based on mass averaged velocity (and mass fraction gradient), molar averaged velocity (and mole fraction gradient) and volume averaged velocity based on concentration gradient are all the same.  But diffusion coefficient based on density gradient and mass averaged velocity is not the same as the previous three !


We live in confusing times - be careful with definitions.

Also we have a test of C slot on Monday at 10am in CRC 102
*101
Before Concepts test I would like you all to read papers in literature on the following topics having relevant heat and mass transfer topics

Solid Dissolution (spinning disk of benzoic acid)

Taylor Vortices


Thermal food sterilization


Flow down a falling film


LMTD in heat exchangers


etc.


You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19

This form is floated to have people on the Department Charter Review Committee. Interested students can join this committee. Department Charter is the Rule Book of the department constituting of the procedures and structures of the organizations in the Department. Your responsibility as a part of the Committee is to help facilitate the drafting of Charter by giving valuable inputs and reviewing the work of Department Legislator in the same context. The drafting of the Department Charter might take time and will undergo several iterations thus brace yourselves.
Note: The Committee is open only for current Second and Third year students.

Ref.: p.66-p.67 of Seader and Henley's book (Chapter 3)


Leveque solution gives local Sh for high Graetz number viz. Pe/(x/D)



Hausen correlation  gives average Sh


Let us integrate Leveque solution for kc_local and then see if the average Sh based on this matches with correlation.


See scanned notes attached


Match is good.  Correlation is an approximate expression given for our convenience.  Hence exact match does not occur but the values are close enough
So many students have asked me this doubt hence I confirmed this from the HOD and got back to you guys.
*You need to compulsorily complete an eight weeks industrial internship by the end of your degree.* So BTechs who are planning to do a research intern should definitely do an industrial intern this summer for a min of 8 weeks.
Now for others, it is advisable to do an industrial internship but you can choose any of your internship: either second year summer or third year summer to be converted into the compulsory industrial intern. 
Also, the internship need not be core. However, if it is non core, you need a letter of approval from one of the *systems engineering profs* of our dept to agree that you are indeed doing something close to systems engineering in that non core internship.
The systems engineering profs are:
1. Arun K Tangirala
2. Sreedhar Kumar Narasimhan
3. Shankar Narasimhan
4. Raghunathan Rengaswamy 
5. Niket Kaisare

Heat Transfer in Tubes under laminar and turbulent flow conditions


Reynolds and Chilton-Colburn Analogies


Closed Book, Closed Notes, No mobiles


10 AM -10:50 AM on coming Monday
Test portion for Monday C slot
to further explain, this includes application of correlations
Test instructions:
CIRCLE ONE correct answer in the Objective Type Questions.  



Choices if corrected will have to be endorsed by one of the invigilators.
What is interfacial tension?


Similar to surface tension - for gas-liquid systems


It applies for liquid-liquid systems (e.g. water-kerosene)


It is a measure of the energy required to create new surface.  For big drops in liquid  if interfacial tension is high then they tend

to remain big because of high energy requirement to break them into small drops.  Hence agitation leading to eddies formation is required to break them into smaller drops.  We need smaller drops because they have more interfacial area per unit volume.  

However, if interfacial tension is less, then drops break easily and tend to cause emulsions.   

Drops may exhibit interfacial turbulence exhibiting  Marangoni phenomena that include

a.  Ripples

b.  eruptions

c. offshoot of mass

d. violent and erratic pulsations of the drop
d.  spontaneous emulsification

These cause higher than expected mass transfer.  


Causes


a.  composition variation along the interface from mass transfer
b.  temperature variation along the interface from heat transfer


These lead to interfacial tension gradients since interfacial tension is a temperature and composition dependent property.


Also deviations from equilibrium shape of the drop due to extension and contraction of the interface tends to create these interfacial disturbances.


Moral:  


Simple additive resistances from inverse of mass transfer coefficients and m is only a first estimate of overall resistance.


Keeping silence in class will enable better understanding

No idea
In turbulent flow correlation  Re = L*v*rho/mu

If L is increased 2 times, v is decreased two times, Re is unaffected and so is Nu.  However if the flow regime changes if v is decreased from 100 m/s to 50 m/s turbulent flow correlation does not apply even if Re is not affected.  

In flow past immersed bodies, (unlike in tubes where velocity and diameter are interlinked), when characteristic dimension of the body is increased and velocity decreased and flow regime may change i.e. become  laminar from turbulent in which case the same correlation may not apply.
Please make the correction to 0.943 (=4/3 times the local value) for falling film laminar vertical plate film condensation for average heat transfer coefficient (h^bar)

 laminar film condensation in for horizontal tube​ the pre-constant for average (h^bar) is 0.725.

Thanks for bringing it out.
​Quiz I average - 14/20

Quiz II average - 12/30

Barath doesn't have it. They removed it. I'm asking around in the CH16 batch
You could also ask your seniors for it
No
*Assignment has to be submitted before 4pm today.* It will be graded and returned before quiz 1.

The lab reports will be graded and returned after all the lab classes.
Yes
Yes
Does anyone have D slot?
There's no lab tomorrow.
No. April fool's preponed.
No dumbfuck there's no lab tomorrow
Because of this
That I don't know. Renga told me that there's no lab tomorrow
I think in the schedule there wasn't a lab scheduled for this week
Yeah there wasn't.
So the from now onwards, Monday and Tuesday lab will be like Thermo lab of last sem for report submission and attendance i.e. everyone waits outside the class and enters on submitting the report and giving the attendance.
If you're going home during Dussehra, don't leave on 2nd which is a Wednesday. You can go on 3rd or 4th. We have the freshie night on 2nd. 
Additionally, people who have already booked tickets and will not be here on 2nd, please to say in the group.

Surprise test in A slot
Come. Prof is not here

Monday's lab:
3 more experiments are left excluding today's. So 21st, 28th and 29th. The report submission for the lab on 28th isn't to be submitted on 29th.
4th is the make up lab for both batches, Monday and Tuesday
Adding more bad news, there's no lab on 28th but that's a lab this Saturday for the Monday batch. 2-5
Because the lab staff are going home for Diwali
Pls to collect A slot surprise tests 6 and 7 from me
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5LeP5731WjlUd1fb-77-rLGrszsIiLHGnfluHhmZTGfUbZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
Pls to fill this by today
Only Wednesday lab junta
Particle characterisation
Yes
Reminder
There's no lab this Saturday. So instead of that we will have it next Thursday.
So overall, Monday's batch we have 3 lab classes left which are on 21st (Monday), 24th (Thursday) and 29th (Tuesday)
Tuesday's batch: no change
4th
In the existing curriculum, there are 2 design related courses – CH4010 (Process & product design) & CH4050 (Chemical Technology & Equipment Design), both offered simultaneously in the 7th semester. The department is considering moving CH4050 to the 8th semester. 

I'm sending a Google form. People who have issues with this fill that up by Tuesday. If there aren't any responses, I'll assume no one has a issue with it
https://forms.gle/YYtsa7Ucz9FBB1Go7

You'll be kept anonymous.
To explain better, I'll compile the answers from here and forward it.
Nope
If the CRE asks whether to keep the end sems open notes or closed notes, we're going for closed notes. Easier paper
You know it's absolute grading, right?
It'll def be easier than open notes
Because the content wasn't a lot
I don't even understand why we're having a discussion on this. Closed notes means easier paper than open notes, regardless of whether he screws us or not. And it's better to go for an easier paper if it is absolute grading
So it doesn't matter for you
Right?
Because he doesn't give a fuck
10:1 majority. Oops
If he does. He did last year. I'm hoping he does this year too
We didn't piss him off this year so he should, right? 😅
F
No
No A slot class tomorrow but Saturday we have extra class from 10:30
He didn't confirm yet. But it's happening mostly. They only wanted to know the issues it would create and I don't think that us wanting to keep our final semester free of compulsory courses is a reason they'd accept. So...
She's not talking about your mail thing -.-
Guys, we have our department GBM today at 6 pm in MSB 241. I request all of you to come. We’ll be reviewing all the work done till now and passing the Department Charter. It won’t take more than half hour.
