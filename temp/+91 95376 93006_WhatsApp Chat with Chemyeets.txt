Here is the App for the position of Department Secretary for our department. This post entails the responsibility of working alongside the Department Legislator to implement the initiatives and solve critical problems of the department. 
A reminder to fill this.
Batch B has to submit the lab report on 20th to Prof Ethaya
Please bring calculators tomorrow for C slot
No
Yes
That's quiz 2
Submission also on Monday?
I'll confirm tomorrow anyway
Also when does everyone want the concept test? Next Wednesday or Friday? 
Thanks

Ref.: p.66-p.67 of Seader and Henley's book (Chapter 3)
So many students have asked me this doubt hence I confirmed this from the HOD and got back to you guys.
Alright
The submission for tomorrow maybe either handwritten or a printout. But handwritten is preferred. 
Should've rejected you when I had the chance üòè

Yes
So I'll clarify. The paper you chose has to uploaded here. And the summary has to submitted in class
You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.
Roll numbers
Any group wants to repeat an experiment or any student who was absent & need to do an experiment, PM me. So that arrangements will be made for doing the experiment next week.
Which one!
*?
1 or 2?
Yes
So just in case anyone is still confused, tomorrow there is an exchange of B and D slots and we have a D slot class tomorrow.

Pls to collect A slot surprise tests 6 and 7 from me

In the existing curriculum, there are 2 design related courses ‚Äì CH4010 (Process & product design) & CH4050 (Chemical Technology & Equipment Design), both offered simultaneously in the 7th semester. The department is considering moving CH4050 to the 8th semester. 
https://forms.gle/YYtsa7Ucz9FBB1Go7
To explain better, I'll compile the answers from here and forward it.
Nope
If the CRE asks whether to keep the end sems open notes or closed notes, we're going for closed notes. Easier paper
You know it's absolute grading, right?
It'll def be easier than open notes
Because the content wasn't a lot
I don't even understand why we're having a discussion on this. Closed notes means easier paper than open notes, regardless of whether he screws us or not. And it's better to go for an easier paper if it is absolute grading
So it doesn't matter for you
Right?
Because he doesn't give a fuck
10:1 majority. Oops
This message was deleted
If he does. He did last year. I'm hoping he does this year too
We didn't piss him off this year so he should, right? üòÖ

No
No A slot class tomorrow but Saturday we have extra class from 10:30
He didn't confirm yet. But it's happening mostly. They only wanted to know the issues it would create and I don't think that us wanting to keep our final semester free of compulsory courses is a reason they'd accept. So...
She's not talking about your mail thing -.-
