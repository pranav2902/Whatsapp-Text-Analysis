Hello,


Diffusion and Fick's law are deceptively simple.  Be careful in defining the appropriate form of Fick's law.  Mass fraction gradient drives diffusion while density gradient caused by temperature differences drive natural convection and the latter is not described by Fick's law.  So mass fraction gradient is more fundamental.  

Also volume averaged velocity is better than mass/molar average velocity.  This is based on partial molar properties (V_1Bar * N_1+V_2bar*N_2) and explicitly defined on concentration gradient.    

We cannot always assume constant total concentration and take rho_t or C_t within the gradient in Fick's law based on mass fraction or mole fraction driving forces.   

So exercise Fick's law with caution.


In the fundamental form, Fick's diffusion coefficients based on mass averaged velocity (and mass fraction gradient), molar averaged velocity (and mole fraction gradient) and volume averaged velocity based on concentration gradient are all the same.  But diffusion coefficient based on density gradient and mass averaged velocity is not the same as the previous three !


We live in confusing times - be careful with definitions.

Also we have a test of C slot on Monday at 10am in CRC 102
*101
Before Concepts test I would like you all to read papers in literature on the following topics having relevant heat and mass transfer topics

Solid Dissolution (spinning disk of benzoic acid)

Taylor Vortices


Thermal food sterilization


Flow down a falling film


LMTD in heat exchangers


etc.


You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19


Format of the 1 page summary


Concept studied:


Mis-concept that you may have had:

This form is floated to have people on the Department Charter Review Committee. Interested students can join this committee. Department Charter is the Rule Book of the department constituting of the procedures and structures of the organizations in the Department. Your responsibility as a part of the Committee is to help facilitate the drafting of Charter by giving valuable inputs and reviewing the work of Department Legislator in the same context. The drafting of the Department Charter might take time and will undergo several iterations thus brace yourselves.
Note: The Committee is open only for current Second and Third year students.

Leveque solution gives local Sh for high Graetz number viz. Pe/(x/D)



Hausen correlation  gives average Sh


Let us integrate Leveque solution for kc_local and then see if the average Sh based on this matches with correlation.


See scanned notes attached


Match is good.  Correlation is an approximate expression given for our convenience.  Hence exact match does not occur but the values are close enough
So many students have asked me this doubt hence I confirmed this from the HOD and got back to you guys.
*You need to compulsorily complete an eight weeks industrial internship by the end of your degree.* So BTechs who are planning to do a research intern should definitely do an industrial intern this summer for a min of 8 weeks.
Now for others, it is advisable to do an industrial internship but you can choose any of your internship: either second year summer or third year summer to be converted into the compulsory industrial intern. 
Also, the internship need not be core. However, if it is non core, you need a letter of approval from one of the *systems engineering profs* of our dept to agree that you are indeed doing something close to systems engineering in that non core internship.
The systems engineering profs are:
1. Arun K Tangirala
2. Sreedhar Kumar Narasimhan
3. Shankar Narasimhan
4. Raghunathan Rengaswamy 
5. Niket Kaisare

Test instructions:
CIRCLE ONE correct answer in the Objective Type Questions.  



Choices if corrected will have to be endorsed by one of the invigilators.
What is interfacial tension?


Similar to surface tension - for gas-liquid systems


It applies for liquid-liquid systems (e.g. water-kerosene)


It is a measure of the energy required to create new surface.  For big drops in liquid  if interfacial tension is high then they tend

to remain big because of high energy requirement to break them into small drops.  Hence agitation leading to eddies formation is required to break them into smaller drops.  We need smaller drops because they have more interfacial area per unit volume.  

However, if interfacial tension is less, then drops break easily and tend to cause emulsions.   

Drops may exhibit interfacial turbulence exhibiting  Marangoni phenomena that include

a.  Ripples

b.  eruptions

c. offshoot of mass

d. violent and erratic pulsations of the drop
d.  spontaneous emulsification

These cause higher than expected mass transfer.  


Causes


a.  composition variation along the interface from mass transfer
b.  temperature variation along the interface from heat transfer


These lead to interfacial tension gradients since interfacial tension is a temperature and composition dependent property.


Also deviations from equilibrium shape of the drop due to extension and contraction of the interface tends to create these interfacial disturbances.


Moral:  


Simple additive resistances from inverse of mass transfer coefficients and m is only a first estimate of overall resistance.


Keeping silence in class will enable better understanding

No idea
In turbulent flow correlation  Re = L*v*rho/mu

If L is increased 2 times, v is decreased two times, Re is unaffected and so is Nu.  However if the flow regime changes if v is decreased from 100 m/s to 50 m/s turbulent flow correlation does not apply even if Re is not affected.  

In flow past immersed bodies, (unlike in tubes where velocity and diameter are interlinked), when characteristic dimension of the body is increased and velocity decreased and flow regime may change i.e. become  laminar from turbulent in which case the same correlation may not apply.
Please make the correction to 0.943 (=4/3 times the local value) for falling film laminar vertical plate film condensation for average heat transfer coefficient (h^bar)

 laminar film condensation in for horizontal tube‚Äã the pre-constant for average (h^bar) is 0.725.

Monday's lab:
3 more experiments are left excluding today's. So 21st, 28th and 29th. The report submission for the lab on 28th isn't to be submitted on 29th.
4th is the make up lab for both batches, Monday and Tuesday
Adding more bad news, there's no lab on 28th but that's a lab this Saturday for the Monday batch. 2-5
Because the lab staff are going home for Diwali
Pls to collect A slot surprise tests 6 and 7 from me
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5LeP5731WjlUd1fb-77-rLGrszsIiLHGnfluHhmZTGfUbZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
Pls to fill this by today
Only Wednesday lab junta
Particle characterisation
Yes
Reminder
There's no lab this Saturday. So instead of that we will have it next Thursday.
So overall, Monday's batch we have 3 lab classes left which are on 21st (Monday), 24th (Thursday) and 29th (Tuesday)
Tuesday's batch: no change
4th
In the existing curriculum, there are 2 design related courses ‚Äì CH4010 (Process & product design) & CH4050 (Chemical Technology & Equipment Design), both offered simultaneously in the 7th semester. The department is considering moving CH4050 to the 8th semester. 

I'm sending a Google form. People who have issues with this fill that up by Tuesday. If there aren't any responses, I'll assume no one has a issue with it
https://forms.gle/YYtsa7Ucz9FBB1Go7

You'll be kept anonymous.
To explain better, I'll compile the answers from here and forward it.
Nope
If the CRE asks whether to keep the end sems open notes or closed notes, we're going for closed notes. Easier paper
You know it's absolute grading, right?
It'll def be easier than open notes
Because the content wasn't a lot
I don't even understand why we're having a discussion on this. Closed notes means easier paper than open notes, regardless of whether he screws us or not. And it's better to go for an easier paper if it is absolute grading
So it doesn't matter for you
Right?
Because he doesn't give a fuck
10:1 majority. Oops
If he does. He did last year. I'm hoping he does this year too
We didn't piss him off this year so he should, right? üòÖ
F
No
No A slot class tomorrow but Saturday we have extra class from 10:30
He didn't confirm yet. But it's happening mostly. They only wanted to know the issues it would create and I don't think that us wanting to keep our final semester free of compulsory courses is a reason they'd accept. So...
She's not talking about your mail thing -.-
Guys, we have our department GBM today at 6 pm in MSB 241. I request all of you to come. We‚Äôll be reviewing all the work done till now and passing the Department Charter. It won‚Äôt take more than half hour.
