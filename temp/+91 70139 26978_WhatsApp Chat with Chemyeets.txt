Hey all,

No No..Please don't fret already. This is not another boring online survey that's going to take a lot of your time. This is an online survey which we are conducting as a part of our social psychology course assignment.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsnJRqbS9ZaXp0muNxP7sGllCdHKF7iGpJ0N6cnH9h0XlN8g/viewform 

You only need to answer less than 10 MCQs. It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to fill it. We would really appreciate your cooperation in our amateur attempt to understand some social psychology concepts.

P.S: This is a voluntary survey and 100 percent confidentiality is assured. And in case you are interested, do get in touch with us and we will share the results of our short study with you.

Thanks in advance!

My comment to the discussion on the paper attached and highlighted above is as follows

These are well known.  What about cases involving very low Pr numbers i.e. liquid metals where thermal boundary layer will grow faster than hydrodynamic boundary layer.  However, the thermal boundary layer may not get fully developed until and unless the velocity boundary layer gets eventually fully developed.  So we have a situation where despite thermal diffusivity being higher than momentum diffusivity, entrance length for hydrodynamic boundary layer may be shorter than thermal boundary layer in contrast with other cases.  However, the two entry lengths may not be too different as the moment the velocity boundary layer is established, the thermal boundary layer will be established as well owing to very high thermal diffusivity.  So perhaps this case does fit into the case of low Pr numbers discussed by authors above.  When fluid properties take effect, things become more complicated.  

Ozisik seems to agree with this assessment as he says that when Pr is low, (nu < alfa), thermal entrance length is higher than hydrodynamic entrance length and is a weak function of Pr until Pr is about 0.07.  So when Pr is < 0.07 (liquid metals), entrance length is stil longer than hydrodynamic entrance length but no longer dependent on Pr.
Come to 304 & 305 for Kannan's test

According to Cussler  

Sc^2/3 was used by Colburn because in those days slide rules were used and they only had square root and cube roots.  He admitted 2/3 exponent is perhaps not a great fit to the experimental data

*Young Engineer and Scientist (Y-E-S) Award* was instituted by the *Honda Foundation* in India in 2007 to nurture young students who have excelled in the area of science and technology. 
 Every year 14 students are selected from the different IITs. *Each Y-E-S Award recipient will receive USD 3,000* in equivalent Indian Rupees that shall be utilized solely for pursuing Education/ Skill Development by the student.  
In addition, every Y-E-S Award recipient becomes eligible for the Y-E-S Award Plus, an additional award within four years after he/she received the Y-E-S Award. Students are eligible for an *internship in a Japanese company or research institute*. Internship participants will receive *USD 7,000 for internship in Japan + USD 3,000 preparation fees for further study in Japan* under Y-E-S Plus OR students may opt for USD 10,000 for *Post-Graduation studies in Japan (1-2 years).*

In the 12th edition (Last Year) of Honda Y-E-S Award there were 3 students from IIT Madras who have received this prestigious Award, i.e. *Mr. Sai Uttej Koduri (Automobile Engineering), Mr. Mayur Joshi(Mechanical Engineering) & Mr. Akila Rajan(Mechanical Engineering). Mr. Sai Uttej Koduri* have opted for Honda Y-E-S Plus program & *went to Japan for 10 weeks of Internship*.

This year application registration process for Honda Y-E-S Award program will *starts from 1st August, 2019; Last Date of receiving the applications will be 31st August, 2019.*

Greetings everyone!

We are looking for student volunteers (as per requirement from the Academic section) for our 56th convocation which would be happening department wise. 

It has been requested to depute 5 PG students & 3 UG students as volunteers (+ 2 back-ups from each) so that convocation can be conducted smoothly.

Dr. R. Nagarajan, HoD of our Department, has suggested 2 students from B.Tech., 1 from DD, 2 from M.Tech., 1 from M.S. and 2 from Ph.D.

We are looking for good organizational skills, although prior experience is not mandatory.
