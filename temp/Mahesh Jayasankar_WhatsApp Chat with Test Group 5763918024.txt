Need a spam bot
Perfect time to start researching how to spam on WhatsApp lmao
Ok sounds good, I'll hit it up as well
Also as a secondary utility we could rank the most used emojis; this is my favourite one 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
I'll end all my sentences with that 👌🏽
So make sure to use 👍🏽 emojis 😏😏 frequently 👌🏽
Maybe insert a few as noise in your text 👌🏽
Hey can you remove the emoji from group title and add some unique number sequence instead?
👌🏽
No I just realised if we are to use scripts, then we may need to have the group title as something typable👌🏽
And the number sequence just because 👌🏽
Ok cool 👌🏽
... On second thoughts it's against WhatsApp TOS to automate message-sending. I don't wanna get banned and neither do you 😅. We'll stick to brute messaging👌🏽
Also, one more thing you should test: 👌🏽
Kick me from group, send a series of messages and then add me again👌🏽
I want to see if my chat log picks all that up 👌🏽
If not then my theory about needing group creator to mail you the log will be correct 👌🏽
Say, should we start a GitHub for this? 👌🏼
No dude
If we need to co-dev the project we need a repository we can both access
Since you're the one with the *professional experience* I thought you could set it up 😕
👌🏼
We're gonna have to comb through image files as well👌🏼
So send some dummy attachments 👌🏼
No but whether it will be output in the log that “at xx/xx/xxxx xx:xx:xx yyy sent zzz media file”? That's important for the parsing 👌🏼
