"small announcement" more like bik gaya hai yeh election.
Henlo all!
Just a gen public service announcement before the upcoming hostel elections. From what I've understood,the most cringeworthy part of insti is the politics and everything that goes on under the table during elections. Now that we're being exposed to all of this pretty early into our insti life, here are some things that I feel we should all observe. 
Don't just vote for somebody because he's ur friend. Don't do if he's playing the region card. Don't vote for him cuz some senior asked u to do it. Don't do it cuz everyone is doing it too.

Be smart. Make an informed decision. Read their manifesto. Gauge their abilities to drain the swamp that exists, not add to to it instead. Hopefully all of this will rid the elections of the divisiveness that they cause. Stop judging people's abilities based on their region. Judge them sheerly on the basis of their manifesto. Be objective.
Be intelligent.
Felt that some stuff need to be said. Feel free to spam this wherever.
Also @919082120679  I don't think u'll be allowed to vote  cuz the right to do so is reserved for citizens.
After all of that, that's the part u see.
How'd u get here?

So I don't really see a problem. You can go talk to the prof about this.
Every body else has business as usual on Monday. Simple. NOW STOP PUTTING UNFUNNY SPAM.

I'm bout to mail him asking to reschedule tommorow's classes. Which of these options should I ask for?
1-shift the evening class to a slot next week.
2-shift the evening class to a morning slot
Or if you can suggest sumthin better shoot away.
I'll probably ask him to choose between the two anyway.
That's RMN 201 in case y'all didn't know.
I gave him both, we'll see what he says.
You're welcome bichezz.

Insert haha yes hedgehog
No, I'm pretty sure they'll only allow note books
Can we go back to closed book
He'll fuck us over
I don't think he'll go back to the closed book thing tho
Yeah, because they screwed with him
Let's all not go to class or something
Piss him off to make it closed again
Maybe the open book thing is a scam so more people attend classes and take notes
