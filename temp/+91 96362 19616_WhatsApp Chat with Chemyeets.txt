Till quiz2 portion is mostly same
Hi all!
I am *Raj Jain*. I'm standing for the post of *Department Legislator (Academic)*, formerly Branch Councillor.
I'd love to hear what you have to say about the issues our department is facing- be it in academics, projects, interns, senior-junior bonding etc. so I can take proactive measures to address them. I wish for everyone in the department to feel that they are as much a part of the SLC and the Department Consultative Committee as the legislator is.

Help me out by taking out a minute to fill this *tiny little form!*

Hi, I'm Raj. I'm not contesting for department legislator due to personal reasons. Please do not vote for me. 

Apologies for the confusion.

Thanks.
