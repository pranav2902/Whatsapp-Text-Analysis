Our teacher said that the problems will only be given from the tutorial sheets
It's for quiz1
Tomorrow's test will most probably have only one question, that too from tutorials.

Where is it?
Shots fired. xD🔥🔥🤣
All 2017-18 batch of iitm students who volunteered for air wing ncc training to note. Enrolment of cadets are being finalized at a fast pace after checking your suitability/your commitment & serious training over 2 to 3 years/physical test/interview /representation from all branches & State you belongs​. The final selection test  for two flights were over yesterday. Two more flights are called today from evening. All volunteers who gave names on Thursday 17aug are only being considered. All of you were also advised to choose NCC if you are really sincere and serious. Only 10 cadets have withdrawn from ncc due to medical and language problems etc. Some of you were also advised that ncc will not suit you and asked to leave and join Nss or nso. So all those are chosen by ncc instructors will have to continue in NCC only. Your late selection in Nss /nso can not be an excuse to leave ncc  and waste a ncc vacancy for iitm. Your selection  other than in ncc is likely to be invalid. Few more girls seats are still vacant as we have to fill 33%girls as per Govt regulations.

@919537693006 Dictatorship 100
It might actually be.
Bombing a town doesn't qualify as a crime against women
Not my opinion, but it's what these reports consider
See that's a crime against humanity and not particularly targeted against a gender.
Who you wanna ban?
There're many
Whatsapp hax101
Ok Aryan. We accept gurugram is best. Happy?
Do these data only consider  the number of crimes reported? Imagine someone torchured by Isis going to a police station.
mention*
Arre bhai. What we're trying to say is that both these reports, the one which ranked India the most unsafe and the other one you mentioned, are not exactly right as they don't have the appropriate data sets to compare. Moreover, crime rates are not evenly distributed in any country so you can't generalize the ranking for the whole country as it could be influenced heavily by some particular region.
Kuch bhi😑
No. And I don't bother to believe any of this shit

Hi all!
I am *Raj Jain*. I'm standing for the post of *Department Legislator (Academic)*, formerly Branch Councillor.
I'd love to hear what you have to say about the issues our department is facing- be it in academics, projects, interns, senior-junior bonding etc. so I can take proactive measures to address them. I wish for everyone in the department to feel that they are as much a part of the SLC and the Department Consultative Committee as the legislator is.

Help me out by taking out a minute to fill this *tiny little form!*

https://bit.ly/MakeChemGreatAgain
Hi, I'm Raj. I'm not contesting for department legislator due to personal reasons. Please do not vote for me. 

Apologies for the confusion.

Thanks.
