Post some stuff off!!
Yes I'll see online if I can find anything regarding secondary WhatsApp bot stuff
✌
Sure...I'll do some of these✌
Cool ✌
Done
Why though ✌
Is the emoji in the title affecting the text file
Yeah cool ✌
I'll be working on the code tomorrow hopefully
Outside now ✌
Haha ok lol ✌
Nope it won't ✌.I assure you
Yeah if you need the whole complete log that's the best thing to do. Even if we can't get it..we can use groups where we were cofounders ✌
Also need to make sure we use common messaging slang lol✌
Yeah that's what I was planning ..to upload it to GitHub once it's done or something✌
Is that what you meant?
Ah .sure
I'll set one up
No dude..if we export chat without media..No image files will be sent
So no issues✌
