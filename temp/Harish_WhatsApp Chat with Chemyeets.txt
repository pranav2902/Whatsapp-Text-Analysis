Some fresh music and doughnuts at half the actual price on a dry Tuesday? *Himalaya lawns'* your go-to place tomorrow. Come witness this insane madness of unadulterated music by Attva and Grey Shack, two amazing bands based from Chennai. It'll be fun guys! Come off.
Hey guys! If you guys wanna meet (interact with) fun freshies and play wolf at the same time, the time has come.
*Come off at 6 to Himalaya lawns* to show them what Chem dept is all about.
Hey guys! This is Shanmukh, the new ChES secretary.
