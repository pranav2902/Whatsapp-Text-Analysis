I am *Raj Jain*. I'm standing for the post of *Department Legislator (Academic)*, formerly Branch Councillor.
I'd love to hear what you have to say about the issues our department is facing- be it in academics, projects, interns, senior-junior bonding etc. so I can take proactive measures to address them. I wish for everyone in the department to feel that they are as much a part of the SLC and the Department Consultative Committee as the legislator is.

Help me out by taking out a minute to fill this *tiny little form!*

27/02/2019, 22:26 - +91 95376 93006: Hello,


Diffusion and Fick's law are deceptively simple.  Be careful in defining the appropriate form of Fick's law.  Mass fraction gradient drives diffusion while density gradient caused by temperature differences drive natural convection and the latter is not described by Fick's law.  So mass fraction gradient is more fundamental.  

Also volume averaged velocity is better than mass/molar average velocity.  This is based on partial molar properties (V_1Bar * N_1+V_2bar*N_2) and explicitly defined on concentration gradient.    

We cannot always assume constant total concentration and take rho_t or C_t within the gradient in Fick's law based on mass fraction or mole fraction driving forces.   

So exercise Fick's law with caution.


In the fundamental form, Fick's diffusion coefficients based on mass averaged velocity (and mass fraction gradient), molar averaged velocity (and mole fraction gradient) and volume averaged velocity based on concentration gradient are all the same.  But diffusion coefficient based on density gradient and mass averaged velocity is not the same as the previous three !


We live in confusing times - be careful with definitions.

12/03/2019, 01:07 - +91 95376 93006: Before Concepts test I would like you all to read papers in literature on the following topics having relevant heat and mass transfer topics

Solid Dissolution (spinning disk of benzoic acid)

Taylor Vortices


Thermal food sterilization


Flow down a falling film


LMTD in heat exchangers


etc.


You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19


Format of the 1 page summary


Concept studied:


Mis-concept that you may have had:


How the mis-concept was clarified and your concept got strengthened




Happy Reading

Leveque solution gives local Sh for high Graetz number viz. Pe/(x/D)



Hausen correlation  gives average Sh


Let us integrate Leveque solution for kc_local and then see if the average Sh based on this matches with correlation.


See scanned notes attached


Match is good.  Correlation is an approximate expression given for our convenience.  Hence exact match does not occur but the values are close enough

23/03/2019, 17:18 - +91 95376 93006: So many students have asked me this doubt hence I confirmed this from the HOD and got back to you guys.
*You need to compulsorily complete an eight weeks industrial internship by the end of your degree.* So BTechs who are planning to do a research intern should definitely do an industrial intern this summer for a min of 8 weeks.
Now for others, it is advisable to do an industrial internship but you can choose any of your internship: either second year summer or third year summer to be converted into the compulsory industrial intern. 
Also, the internship need not be core. However, if it is non core, you need a letter of approval from one of the *systems engineering profs* of our dept to agree that you are indeed doing something close to systems engineering in that non core internship.
The systems engineering profs are:
1. Arun K Tangirala
2. Sreedhar Kumar Narasimhan
3. Shankar Narasimhan
4. Raghunathan Rengaswamy 
5. Niket Kaisare

24/03/2019, 21:57 - +91 95376 93006: So I'll clarify. The paper you chose has to uploaded here. And the summary has to submitted in class
24/03/2019, 21:57 - +91 95376 93006: You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19

28/03/2019, 09:00 - +91 70139 26978: My comment to the discussion on the paper attached and highlighted above is as follows

These are well known.  What about cases involving very low Pr numbers i.e. liquid metals where thermal boundary layer will grow faster than hydrodynamic boundary layer.  However, the thermal boundary layer may not get fully developed until and unless the velocity boundary layer gets eventually fully developed.  So we have a situation where despite thermal diffusivity being higher than momentum diffusivity, entrance length for hydrodynamic boundary layer may be shorter than thermal boundary layer in contrast with other cases.  However, the two entry lengths may not be too different as the moment the velocity boundary layer is established, the thermal boundary layer will be established as well owing to very high thermal diffusivity.  So perhaps this case does fit into the case of low Pr numbers discussed by authors above.  When fluid properties take effect, things become more complicated.  

Ozisik seems to agree with this assessment as he says that when Pr is low, (nu < alfa), thermal entrance length is higher than hydrodynamic entrance length and is a weak function of Pr until Pr is about 0.07.  So when Pr is < 0.07 (liquid metals), entrance length is stil longer than hydrodynamic entrance length but no longer dependent on Pr.

Fill this form or read below and fill this form.

Can you introspect on how much is it that you on an average spend per week ordering meal online? Rupees 300, 500, 1000, or more than that. Well, you know your number! Or worse, just skipped the meal. 

Now, what I want you to ponder on is how many among these times you had to order/skip because 

*a)*	Waking up on an alarm was only possible if someone told me it was ringing. Duh!
*b)*	You missed the MESS meal because your favourite show made you lose track of time
*c)*	Walking to the MESS was just like losing your arm and leg
*d)*	Succumbing to the peer pressure as none of my friends were going
*e)*	I had my classes/lab and couldn’t risk the W.
*f)* Food is not good.

13/04/2019, 21:37 - +91 95376 93006: What is interfacial tension?


Similar to surface tension - for gas-liquid systems


It applies for liquid-liquid systems (e.g. water-kerosene)


It is a measure of the energy required to create new surface.  For big drops in liquid  if interfacial tension is high then they tend

to remain big because of high energy requirement to break them into small drops.  Hence agitation leading to eddies formation is required to break them into smaller drops.  We need smaller drops because they have more interfacial area per unit volume.  

However, if interfacial tension is less, then drops break easily and tend to cause emulsions.   

Drops may exhibit interfacial turbulence exhibiting  Marangoni phenomena that include

a.  Ripples

b.  eruptions

c. offshoot of mass

d. violent and erratic pulsations of the drop
d.  spontaneous emulsification

These cause higher than expected mass transfer.  


Causes


a.  composition variation along the interface from mass transfer
b.  temperature variation along the interface from heat transfer


These lead to interfacial tension gradients since interfacial tension is a temperature and composition dependent property.


Also deviations from equilibrium shape of the drop due to extension and contraction of the interface tends to create these interfacial disturbances.


Moral:  


Simple additive resistances from inverse of mass transfer coefficients and m is only a first estimate of overall resistance.


Keeping silence in class will enable better understanding

I am pleased to inform you that after a lot of discussion and requests, the HoD has finally agreed to keep the length of the compulsory summer internship for second years as 6 weeks only. Note that it will be mandatory for the students to produce a certificate from the company as a proof of the same.

Thanking you in anticipation,

27/04/2019, 22:49 - +91 95376 93006: In turbulent flow correlation  Re = L*v*rho/mu

If L is increased 2 times, v is decreased two times, Re is unaffected and so is Nu.  However if the flow regime changes if v is decreased from 100 m/s to 50 m/s turbulent flow correlation does not apply even if Re is not affected.  

In flow past immersed bodies, (unlike in tubes where velocity and diameter are interlinked), when characteristic dimension of the body is increased and velocity decreased and flow regime may change i.e. become  laminar from turbulent in which case the same correlation may not apply.
28/04/2019, 02:47 - +91 95376 93006: Please make the correction to 0.943 (=4/3 times the local value) for falling film laminar vertical plate film condensation for average heat transfer coefficient (h^bar)

22/10/2019, 20:23 - +91 91678 79798: No
22/10/2019, 20:24 - +91 95376 93006: You know it's absolute grading, right?
22/10/2019, 20:25 - +91 97310 90474: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:27 - +91 98409 24551: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:28 - Praveen C: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:29 - +91 96501 91968: How sure are we about this? What if he screws us over?
22/10/2019, 20:29 - +91 96501 91968: He is someone who is capable of that
22/10/2019, 20:36 - +91 95376 93006: It'll def be easier than open notes
22/10/2019, 20:38 - +91 91678 79798: U found quiz 1 tougher?
22/10/2019, 20:38 - +91 91678 79798: Both the papers were very similar in terms of easy hard
22/10/2019, 20:39 - Akhil V: +1.. So were my pathetic marks 🥺
22/10/2019, 20:40 - +91 98409 19511: Sameeee
22/10/2019, 20:49 - +91 95376 93006: Because the content wasn't a lot
22/10/2019, 20:50 - +91 95376 93006: I don't even understand why we're having a discussion on this. Closed notes means easier paper than open notes, regardless of whether he screws us or not. And it's better to go for an easier paper if it is absolute grading
22/10/2019, 20:57 - +91 94936 33847: Yeah
22/10/2019, 20:58 - +91 95662 10511: Yee
22/10/2019, 20:58 - +91 77760 81403: Yeah
22/10/2019, 20:58 - +91 94936 33847: But the average is 2 marks higher for q2
22/10/2019, 20:58 - Sriram: Either way it doesn't matter I guess. I guess closed notes are better
22/10/2019, 20:59 - +91 99726 08101: Go for closed notes
22/10/2019, 20:59 - Keerthan: Yes
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: dude the paper will be the way he wants
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: he wont give a fuck paper whether open or closed
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: fuck whether paper is open or closed*
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: So it doesn't matter for you
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: Right?
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: Because he doesn't give a fuck
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 91678 79798: so if its open book it will provide us aid right
22/10/2019, 21:03 - +91 95376 93006: 10:1 majority. Oops
22/10/2019, 21:03 - +91 99691 07519: We talked to seniors. They got fucked because they chose open notes.

22/10/2019, 21:04 - Shashank: Do you think he'll give us a choice?

22/10/2019, 21:05 - Shashank: Oh okay
22/10/2019, 21:05 - +91 95376 93006: We didn't piss him off this year so he should, right? 😅
22/10/2019, 21:05 - Shashank: ✌
22/10/2019, 21:11 - +91 83090 40935: Was the paper too difficult to solve ?

04/11/2019, 21:29 - +91 95376 93006: He didn't confirm yet. But it's happening mostly. They only wanted to know the issues it would create and I don't think that us wanting to keep our final semester free of compulsory courses is a reason they'd accept. So...
04/11/2019, 21:30 - Sriram: But isn't it wiser to change it later? Many wouldn't have planned their courses out for the next 3 sems
