16/08/2017, 15:21 - +91 98196 43479: But what about the life skills class
16/08/2017, 15:21 - +91 98196 43479: You can't move that
16/08/2017, 15:21 - +91 80586 53365: Tuesday lab h
16/08/2017, 15:22 - +91 95376 93006: Life skills bunk
16/08/2017, 15:22 - +91 95376 93006: The only problem about Tuesday is lab. If we want a holiday on Tuesday, we'll have to cancel the lab. No other option
16/08/2017, 15:22 - +91 98196 43479: If there were more than one class per week, bunking one would be fine
16/08/2017, 15:23 - +91 95376 93006: If you want to attend, you attend. No one is forcing you

16/08/2017, 15:34 - +91 70139 26978: I'm not forcing anyone to take a holiday
16/08/2017, 15:34 - +91 95376 93006: Most people in my wing are in support of Lakshita
16/08/2017, 15:35 - +91 75064 77936: Was talking abt Tuesday

But I guess Missing one like skill class can be risky . The percentage may come down bcoz 25th August is also a friday
16/08/2017, 15:38 - +91 96521 59528: *life
16/08/2017, 15:38 - +91 70139 26978: Ha yeah

19/08/2017, 11:20 - +91 98256 45129: Prevent Swine Flu - Good Advice

Dr. Vinay Goyal is an MBBS,DRM,DNB (Intensi invist and Thyroid specialist) having clinical experience of over 20 years. He has worked in institutions like Hinduja Hospital, Bombay Hospital, Saifee Hospital, Tata Memorial etc. Presently, he is heading our Nuclear Medicine Department and Thyroid clinic at Riddhivinayak Cardiac and Critical Centre, Malad (W).

The following message given by him, I feel makes a lot of sense and is important for all to know

The only portals of entry are the nostrils and mouth/throat. In a global epidemic of this nature, it's almost impossible to avoid coming into contact with H1N1 in spite of all precautions. Contact with H1N1 is not so much of a problem as proliferation is.

While you are still healthy and not showing any symptoms of H1N1 infection, in order to prevent proliferation, aggravation of symptoms and development of secondary infections, some very simple steps, not fully highlighted in most official communications, can be practiced (instead of focusing on how to stock N95 or Tamiflu):

1. Frequent hand-washing (well highlighted in all official communications).

2. "Hands-off-the-face" approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face (unless you want to eat, bathe or slap).

3. * Gargle twice a day with warm salt water (use Listerine if you don't trust salt)... * H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat/ nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms. Simple gargling prevents proliferation. In a way, gargling with salt water has the same effect on a healthy individual that Tamiflu has on an infected one. Don't underestimate this simple, inexpensive and powerful preventative method.

4. Similar to 3 above, * clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water. * Not everybody may be good at Jala Neti or Sutra Neti (very good Yoga asanas to clean nasal cavities), but * blowing the nose hard once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population. *

5. * Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits). * If you have to supplement with Vitamin C tablets, make sure that it also has Zinc to boost absorption.

6. * Drink as much of warm liquids (tea, coffee, etc) as you can. * Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction. They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot survive, proliferate or do any harm.

I suggest you pass this on to your entire e-list. You never know who might pay attention to it - and STAY ALIVE because of it...

23/08/2017, 15:11 - +91 96362 19616: All 2017-18 batch of iitm students who volunteered for air wing ncc training to note. Enrolment of cadets are being finalized at a fast pace after checking your suitability/your commitment & serious training over 2 to 3 years/physical test/interview /representation from all branches & State you belongs​. The final selection test  for two flights were over yesterday. Two more flights are called today from evening. All volunteers who gave names on Thursday 17aug are only being considered. All of you were also advised to choose NCC if you are really sincere and serious. Only 10 cadets have withdrawn from ncc due to medical and language problems etc. Some of you were also advised that ncc will not suit you and asked to leave and join Nss or nso. So all those are chosen by ncc instructors will have to continue in NCC only. Your late selection in Nss /nso can not be an excuse to leave ncc  and waste a ncc vacancy for iitm. Your selection  other than in ncc is likely to be invalid. Few more girls seats are still vacant as we have to fill 33%girls as per Govt regulations.

30/08/2017, 20:17 - +91 97310 90474: Should we ask phys sir to shift mini test on 11th?
30/08/2017, 20:17 - +91 97310 90474: Because we have thermo quiz this monday
30/08/2017, 20:17 - +91 97310 90474: And 11th is phys quiz so we need to study anyway
30/08/2017, 20:18 - +91 97310 90474: ?
30/08/2017, 20:20 - Priyansh Chem: +1
30/08/2017, 20:23 - Akhil chem: True ...if possible please
30/08/2017, 20:26 - Abhiram Chem: Physics mini test and quiz on same day ? Awesome.  Do it
30/08/2017, 20:29 - +91 98196 43479: There won't be Phy lecture on that day
30/08/2017, 20:30 - +91 98196 43479: So mini test won't be possible on quiz day
30/08/2017, 20:30 - Akhil chem: Don't keep it before the physics test ..that's the point...it's ok...we can do it on Tuesday
30/08/2017, 20:31 - Abhiram Chem: Oh.. the next day perhaps?12 th ?
30/08/2017, 20:31 - Akhil chem: Yes... possible Right
30/08/2017, 20:33 - +91 97310 90474: Why?

30/08/2017, 20:39 - +91 98196 43479: Thermo guy can't afford to lose his slot on that day
30/08/2017, 21:03 - +91 95376 93006: Mini tests can't be postponed
30/08/2017, 21:03 - +91 77760 81403: Why
30/08/2017, 21:03 - +91 95376 93006: It's for entry batch
30/08/2017, 21:03 - Akhil chem: Why
30/08/2017, 21:03 - +91 95376 93006: *every
30/08/2017, 21:04 - +91 96521 59528: You will have to combine all the phy profs

30/08/2017, 21:04 - +91 96521 59528: And all you have to do is read the solutions and go
30/08/2017, 21:07 - +91 95376 93006: Are you saying in support of me or against me?
30/08/2017, 21:08 - +91 96521 59528: Support

30/08/2017, 22:12 - +91 97310 90474: Everyone with physics will want mini test postponed. So i think we may be able to convince
30/08/2017, 22:12 - Akhil chem: Yes
30/08/2017, 22:14 - +91 97310 90474: So guys just tell ur friends to talk abt it to their profs if u want mini test postponed
30/08/2017, 22:14 - +91 95376 93006: Aye dumbfucks. It is for all the batches. It's like quiz
30/08/2017, 22:15 - +91 97310 90474: All bathes as in all years?

30/08/2017, 22:16 - +91 95376 93006: All who have thermo quiz do
30/08/2017, 22:16 - +91 97310 90474: So they will want mini test postponed
30/08/2017, 22:16 - +91 95376 93006: 😑
30/08/2017, 22:17 - +91 97310 90474: Plus it makes everyone's life easier because they will have to study for phys quiz anyway
30/08/2017, 22:17 - +91 97310 90474: So there is a high chance that everyone will want it postponed
30/08/2017, 22:18 - +91 95376 93006: I can't digest how dumb you are
30/08/2017, 22:18 - +91 95376 93006: I can't

30/08/2017, 22:21 - +91 95376 93006: Go ask
30/08/2017, 22:21 - +91 97310 90474: Would u like to postpone it?
30/08/2017, 22:21 - +91 95376 93006: Doesn't differ
30/08/2017, 22:21 - +91 97310 90474: Oh

30/08/2017, 22:22 - +91 97310 90474: And they are hard
30/08/2017, 22:22 - +91 95376 93006: If you want it postponed, go talk to Physics prof
30/08/2017, 22:22 - +91 97310 90474: Ya
30/08/2017, 22:22 - +91 97310 90474: Ill see if i can do something

30/08/2017, 22:50 - +91 97310 90474: This is almost necessary for higher physics
30/08/2017, 22:51 - +91 80893 64396: Fuck this shit nigguh
30/08/2017, 22:51 - +91 80893 64396: It's pointless..

22/09/2017, 20:42 - +91 80891 23999: Guys, please don’t take your health and body for granted. Avinash had high fever since Friday, he had booked tickets for some weekend trip so he asked Insti doctor for medicines to control the body temperature and went for the trip. Honestly, I would have done the same thing if I was in his place and so would have most of us. We have taken dengue very lightly because we know it has cure and lot of our friends have survived dengue taking rest in their rooms. Last Monday after he returned from the trip I had met him in Insti hospital, he was there for getting his blood tested. We conversed while cycling back to hostel. Only the first few minutes were about high fever and dengue, but soon we switched the topic to his Yercaud trip. Neither of us knew the seriousness of the situation, atleast I didn’t and he didn’t show it. Now, when I think about it, it shows how little we care about our health. The next day evening he was told that it was serious and he needs to be admitted in Apollo Hospital immediately. I hadn’t talked or seen him since Monday. Its is difficult to believe things can change so drastically in 4 days. 4 days back he was healthy enough to cycle and converse with me the whole way from Insti Hospital to Hostel. Guys, if you have slightest of doubt that you may have dengue, please get yourself checked. As Siddarth said, like in case of Avinash, it could be some rare unusual case of dengue.
Its better regretting missing a great trip rather than not being able to regret missing your life.

27/10/2017, 00:55 - Preetham Saathi: Nova deals with food fest which happens in saarang and which is considered to be one of the best south India. It also deals with conducting workshops on various things, this year we are planning to host an anime con for the first time in IIT Madras. You people can have an amazing experience working and I am sure that you people will enjoy. This even helps you to build up contacts with a lot of seniors with will be quite helpful in the coming years.
If you have any other doubts etc pm me
27/10/2017, 02:31 - +91 95376 93006: Hey all,

Today, the 27th of October, LitSoc brings to you its next event - What's The Good Word.

Dialogues, autopsies, obituaries, education- did you notice those four words had all five vowels in them? Eda, did you realize Idnih, Limat, Ugulet, Adannak and Hsilgne do not make sense, while Malayalam does? Tom Marvolo Riddle ---> I am Lord Voldemort?

How quickly can you find out what is so unusual about this paragraph? It looks so ordinary that you would think that nothing is wrong with it at all, and, in fact, nothing is. But it is unusual. Why?

Words are fun things. WTGW is a badass fun event involving those fun things. So grab a friend and come along for a night with words.

VENUE: MSB 242
DATE: Oct 27th, 2017 (Friday)
TIME: 7:00 pm

It's a team of 2 event. And there is limit on no.of teams per hostel, how many ever teams can go!

Interested people contact me (9566336037)

Regards,
Surya S

There are quite a few people coming up to us asking about what exactly chemical engineering is and what scope do we have on core side.
So we wanted to have a seminar with Prof. Kannan, head of the department.
But we'll have it only if you guys want it. I don't want it like last time where half of the batch didn't turn up.
So let me know by tonight if you guys want it. Only then I'll be able to talk with sir.
Let me know by tonight!
We'll have it somewhere in next week so that your "end sem prep" is not disturbed!

29/10/2017, 23:34 - +91 94936 33847: Henlo all!
Just a gen public service announcement before the upcoming hostel elections. From what I've understood,the most cringeworthy part of insti is the politics and everything that goes on under the table during elections. Now that we're being exposed to all of this pretty early into our insti life, here are some things that I feel we should all observe. 
Don't just vote for somebody because he's ur friend. Don't do if he's playing the region card. Don't vote for him cuz some senior asked u to do it. Don't do it cuz everyone is doing it too.

Be smart. Make an informed decision. Read their manifesto. Gauge their abilities to drain the swamp that exists, not add to to it instead. Hopefully all of this will rid the elections of the divisiveness that they cause. Stop judging people's abilities based on their region. Judge them sheerly on the basis of their manifesto. Be objective.
Be intelligent.

Prof. Pushpavanam is one our senior most faculty. He was our HoD from 2009-12. He too is a graduate from IIT Madras and later went on to do PhD from the University of Florida.

13/11/2017, 23:35 - +91 91762 81964: Recently in IIT (BHU), we witnessed disturbance in the peaceful environment due to some 100 hooligans entering our campus on bikes and they manhandled security guards and security officers. Details of the incident are in this video (https://www.facebook.com/sp.iitbhu/videos/1900598259955085/). 
This is not something which is new to us. We face similar issues as our security system is not competent enough to deal with the open campus. We started this online petition ( https://www.change.org/p/president-of-india-saveiitbhu ) and the situation is explained in that clearly. As a sister IIT, we expect a strong support from the students of IIT Madras too. Please forward this to your peers and support our petition by signing it. 

Thank You.

Please send messages to your department first years about basic exam etiquette like not possessing a mobile phone, having an ID card etc etc. Also advise them to have breakfast before going to the exam.

Insist on importance of tutorials especially for MA, PH, Thermo etc etc
14/11/2017, 23:00 - +91 91762 81964: *Some tips for MA1100:*

*1.Try to be very clear with the theory.Understand the formula and situations in which it can be used.*

*2.Solve all previous year papers from civil IITM and then ensure that you cover the tutorials comprehensively*

*3.In maths the questions are easy but most of the marks are lost due to silly mistakes.Have a good   night's sleep so that you are attentive during the exam*

DMC Presents Emergency Medical Care Workshop 2017


"Compassion without awareness is merely a good intention
whereas, compassion with awareness leads to action"


Greetings from Team DMC 2017!!


Misfortune never foretells..!!
Accidents can happen anytime and anywhere.

Are you prepared for them when they do happen? Do you think you can do the right thing to make a difference to someone's life or even your own?

It is imperative to maintain your calm and be confident in case of an emergency. 

Watching a video or knowing the theory may not enable you help the victim. It requires conditioning which comes only when you practice.

Disaster Management Committee, IIT Madras in association with ALERT (Amenity Lifeline Emergency Response Team) is organizing the Emergency Medical Care workshop. The workshop aims at empowering the key stakeholders First Year B.Tech's of IIT Madras towards handling any medical emergency.

The workshop will provide an emergency medical training on first-aid, CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), Heimlich maneuver, etc.

Hands-on training will be provided.

First Year B.tech's Kindly note that the attendance is compulsory. Attendance will be submitted to dean's office.

04/01/2018, 08:40 - Akhil chem: ONLY FOR INDIAN #LIBTARDS & #SICKULARS-

Sydney blew up 8,000 kg of fireworks last night. Dubai scored a Guinness World Record by launching 479,651 firework shells in 6 minutes. And these are just 2 places of 2 cities out of 4,416 other cities that celebrated new year's eve. Not a single celebrity cringed. No one cried. Nobody's dog had a problem. Instead there were selfies, smiles and joy all around. And the best part is that with such a gigantic production, the whole world must be totally oxygenated today. Feels so awesome, no?

New Year's Eve is a mysterious night for every scientist & chemical engineer. Because this is the only time in the year when firecrackers emit oxygen. That's why despite all the fireworks throughout the world, no environmentalist has a problem, because it emits only oxygen today, while on other days, and especially on Hindu festivals like Deepavali, it emits carbon dioxide & all kinds of toxins. This is something which has puzzled scientists worldwide & has still remained a mystery.

08/01/2018, 13:25 - +91 98409 19511: पिछले दिनों Gurgoan जाना हुआ । 
वहां एक मित्र  Navi Singh के घर रुका । उनकी छोटी बहन अमरीका में रहती हैं । छुट्टियों में घर आई हुई थीं ।
 बातों बातों में बताने लगी कि 
*अमरीका में बहुत गरीब मजदूर वर्ग McDonald , KFC और Pizza Hut का burger पिज़्ज़ा और chicken खाता है ।*
 

अमरीका और Europe के रईस धनाढ्य करोड़पति लोग *ताज़ी सब्जियों उबाल के खाते हैं ,*
ताज़े गुंधे आटे की गर्मा गर्म bread/रोटी खाना बहुत बड़ी luxury है ।
 
ताज़े फलों और सब्जियों का Salad वहां नसीब वालों को नसीब होता है ........ 
ताजी हरी पत्तेदार सब्जियां अमीर लोग ही Afford कर पाते हैं । 

गरीब लोग Packaged food खाते हैं । 
हफ़्ते / महीने भर का Ration अपने तहखानों में रखे Freezer में रख लेते हैं और उसी को Micro Wave Oven में गर्म कर कर के खाते रहते हैं ।

आजकल भारतीय शहरों के नव धनाढ्य लोग 
*अपने बच्चों का हैप्पी बड्डे मकडोनल में मनाते हैं ।*
 उधर अमरीका में कोई ठीक ठाक सा मिडल किलास आदमी McDonalds में अपने बच्चे का हैप्पी बड्डे मनाने की सोच भी नही सकता ......... 
लोग क्या सोचेंगे ?
 इतने बुरे दिन आ गए ? *इतनी गरीबी आ गयी कि अब बच्चों का हैप्पी बड्डे मकडोनल में मनाना पड़ रहा है ?*


भारत का गरीब से गरीब आदमी भी ताजी सब्जी , ताजी उबली हुई दाल भात खाता है ......... 
ताजा खीरा ककड़ी खाता है।
 अब यहां गुलामी की मानसिकता हमारे दिल दिमाग़ पे किस कदर तारी है ये इस से समझ लीजिये कि
 *Europe अमरीका हमारी तरह ताज़ा भोजन खाने को तरस रहा है और हम हैं कि Fridge में रखा बासी packaged food खाने को तरस रहे हैं ।*

 अमरीकियों की Luxury जो हमें सहज उपलब्ध है हम उसे भूल *उनकी दरिद्रता अपनाने के लिए मरे जाते हैं ।*

ताज़े फल सब्जी खाने हो तो फसल चक्र के हिसाब से दाम घटते बढ़ते रहते है ।

इसके विपरीत डिब्बाबंद Packaged Food के दाम साल भर स्थिर रहते है बल्कि समय के साथ सस्ते होते जाते हैं । 
जैसे जैसे Expiry date नज़दीक आती जाती है , डिब्बाबंद भोजन सस्ता होता जाता है और एक दिन वो भी आ जाता है कि Store के बाहर रख दिया जाता है , 
*लो भाई ले जाओ , मुफ्त में।*
 हर रात 11 बजे Stores के बाहर सैकड़ों लोग इंतज़ार करते हैं ....... 
*Expiry date वाले भोजन का।*


125 करोड़ लोगों की विशाल जनसंख्या का हमारा देश आज तक किसी तरह ताज़ी फल सब्जी भोजन ही खाता आया है ।
*ताज़े भोजन की एक तमीज़ तहज़ीब होती है । ताज़े भोजन की उपलब्धता का एक चक्र होता है । ताज़ा भोजन समय के साथ महंगा सस्ता होता रहता है।*

 आजकल समाचार माध्यमों में टमाटर और हरी सब्जियों के बढ़ते दामों के लेकर जो चिहाड़ मची है 
*वो एक गुलाम कौम का विलाप है ........* 
जो अपनी ऐतिहासिक सांस्कृतिक विरासत को भूल अपनी गुलामी का विलाप कर रही है ।

*भारत बहुत तेज़ी से ताजे भोजन की समृद्धि को त्याग डिब्बेबन्द भोजन की दरिद्रता की ओर अग्रेसर हो रहा है।*

*मोबाइल और मन मष्तिष्क* में पहुँचा दो

Masterstroke By PM Modi !!

No one can match Modi's wit and his sense of humour. !!

To Renuka Chowdhury laughing hysterically during his speech in the Upper House, a smiling PM tells Speaker Naidu: "Please don't stop Renuka-ji. We're fortunate to hear this kind of laughter for the first time since Ramayan"...

08/02/2018, 11:23 - Akhil chem: Not for Akhil
08/02/2018, 11:24 - Akhil chem: See the whole point is if people don't seriously mind getting a holiday on 5 ..why no?
08/02/2018, 11:24 - Akhil chem: We can as well go for that
08/02/2018, 11:24 - +91 95376 93006: I need a treat
08/02/2018, 11:24 - +91 94936 33847: Look. It's not logical getting everybody's lab shifted to Saturday for the sake of two people.
08/02/2018, 11:24 - +91 95376 93006: Simple
08/02/2018, 11:24 - +91 95376 93006: Arre rukk na. Aise nahi samjhega
08/02/2018, 11:25 - Akhil chem: Abee those who want can do on sat..rest can do on Monday
08/02/2018, 11:25 - +91 94936 33847: So I don't really see a problem. You can go talk to the prof about this.
08/02/2018, 11:25 - Akhil chem: Absent was one of the 3 reason why he started a lab on Saturday
08/02/2018, 11:26 - +91 95376 93006: unDERSTANDAble haᵥₑ ₐ ₙᵢcₑ daY
08/02/2018, 11:26 - +91 94936 33847: Every body else has business as usual on Monday. Simple. NOW STOP PUTTING UNFUNNY SPAM.
08/02/2018, 11:26 - +91 97310 90474: 😂😂😂
08/02/2018, 11:26 - Akhil chem: I am not worried abt lab...just that people are saying since we have lab we should not take a holiday..so I was clarifying... I am worried abt classes which have attendance
08/02/2018, 11:27 - +91 95376 93006: Should've thought that before booking tickets
08/02/2018, 11:27 - Akhil chem: I had taken a call..n now since we have an option I am telling what can be done
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 95376 93006: Bad call
08/02/2018, 11:28 - Akhil chem: So it does no harm to others n benifits me as well
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 97310 90474: See its either monday or thursday
08/02/2018, 11:28 - Akhil chem: My opinion.. leave that
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 97310 90474: And monday all slots are booked except 1
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 95376 93006: So not getting holiday on Monday is mine
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 95376 93006: Simple af
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 94936 33847: Dude the CR's struggle to shift one day's timetable after accounting for both the batches' classes. Another day of shifting/cancellation is just impossible.
08/02/2018, 11:28 - +91 97310 90474: So thurs(1st) is better
08/02/2018, 11:29 - +91 94936 33847: Yup.
08/02/2018, 11:29 - Akhil chem: So make it only Monday is what I am saying

08/02/2018, 11:39 - Abhiram Chem: Same.
08/02/2018, 11:39 - Akhil chem: See cr
08/02/2018, 11:39 - +91 95376 93006: Like Monday is a loss to me
08/02/2018, 11:39 - Akhil chem: These people have no probs
08/02/2018, 11:39 - +91 77383 46746: Ok. Simple. Since physics and am classes are not same, just ask your respective profs, then based on that we can conclude. Suppose the cs prof tells no  for bunking  lab on monday, then we have no option but to ask for Thursday
08/02/2018, 11:39 - +91 95376 93006: And everyone else
08/02/2018, 11:39 - Akhil chem: Wtf?

08/02/2018, 11:41 - Akhil chem: N people who haven't booked can do it accordingly
08/02/2018, 11:42 - Akhil chem: N anyway flight rates are expensive on Sunday than on Monday
08/02/2018, 11:42 - Akhil chem: So people,..it's good if u come back on Monday night
08/02/2018, 11:43 - Akhil chem: Please try n understand...what I am telling is doing no bad to anyone what so ever

24/02/2018, 23:36 - +91 98409 19511: For the English experts !! ::::::

For example,

John is taller than I.
-not-

John is taller than me.
-because-

John is taller than I is an elliptical version of John is taller than I am.
And.....

Michael Jordan is better at basketball than I (am).
-not-

Michael Jordan is better at basketball than me.

Now ... since “I” is a subjective pronoun so “I” should be used to refer yourself for a event or work in which you are associated! (Not me )

27/02/2018, 18:49 - +91 98256 45129: *My Mother Can Be Saved if We Try*

I am Amit Ghosh, a student at IIT Madras doing my M.S. program, yet to seek a job and settle in life. On account of unfavourable circumstances and fortune, I need to leave my college and studies and seek for money. My mother is detected with Bilateral Renal Cell Carcinoma(RCC) where multiple cancerous tumours have affected both the kidneys. A difficult case where the suitable solution is Bilateral Nephrectomy i.e. both the kidneys need to removed followed by 3 Dialysis/week. It costs around 5 Lakhs for the operation itself which will be followed by routine Dialysis which will have its expense further, that is unbearable for a lower-middle-class family like me. I have limited time until cancer spreads, yet can't proceed unless the money is arranged. Kindly help me raise some fund for my mother to have her treatment and save her life.

We are a team of very enthusiastic students aiming to represent IIT Madras at the *SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition* conducted annually in *California*. *In our very 1st attempt, we were among the top 47 teams to be selected for the Final Design Round(FDR) out of 1500 teams all over the world.* Hyperloop, touted to be the fifth mode of transport is moving towards commercialization at a very fast rate and this is your chance to make a contribution. The implementation requires application of basic physics to solve complex problems along with its own uncertainties of operating under near vacuum conditions. Moreover, you get a chance to be a part of the team that is actually going to build the pod.

27/03/2018, 18:03 - +91 97310 90474: MH is molal humidity
27/03/2018, 18:03 - +91 97310 90474: Humidity = (nw/na)/(nw*/na*)

03/04/2018, 11:51 - +91 70139 26978: Hey all,

No No..Please don't fret already. This is not another boring online survey that's going to take a lot of your time. This is an online survey which we are conducting as a part of our social psychology course assignment.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsnJRqbS9ZaXp0muNxP7sGllCdHKF7iGpJ0N6cnH9h0XlN8g/viewform 

You only need to answer less than 10 MCQs. It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to fill it. We would really appreciate your cooperation in our amateur attempt to understand some social psychology concepts.

P.S: This is a voluntary survey and 100 percent confidentiality is assured. And in case you are interested, do get in touch with us and we will share the results of our short study with you.

Thanks in advance!

05/04/2018, 23:45 - +91 94936 33847: What exactly is your input?
05/04/2018, 23:46 - Abhiram Chem: You don't input /0
05/04/2018, 23:46 - Abhiram Chem: If you do that, it'll take / and 0 as separate characters.
05/04/2018, 23:46 - Abhiram Chem: '/0' is automatically assigned at the end of the string

06/04/2018, 00:19 - +91 97310 90474: If u use scanf on normal c complilwe u can enter nupl char
06/04/2018, 00:19 - +91 97310 90474: Manually
06/04/2018, 00:20 - +91 97310 90474: Chill it will work
06/04/2018, 00:20 - +91 97310 90474: I think compiler stops reading string when it hits null char
06/04/2018, 00:23 - +91 97310 90474: *if u use printf with string

06/04/2018, 06:55 - Nandini Chem: If I declare an array A(5) and scan 6 elements and try to print those 6 elements, does an error occur? Cuz in gcc, no error is showing up.

06/04/2018, 06:57 - Nandini Chem: No, it isnt junk. Its given in the input
06/04/2018, 06:57 - Nandini Chem: It actually took the 6th element
06/04/2018, 07:01 - +91 77383 46746: <Media omitted>
06/04/2018, 07:02 - +91 77383 46746: In prutor, it prints junk
06/04/2018, 07:03 - Nandini Chem: 👍thanks
06/04/2018, 07:08 - +91 98196 43479: There's no error because your extra inputs are stored in the next memory locations
06/04/2018, 07:08 - +91 98196 43479: C doesn't check array bounds
06/04/2018, 07:09 - +91 98196 43479: The call a[I] is just a pointer
06/04/2018, 07:11 - Nandini Chem: Does that memory location belong to the array?
06/04/2018, 07:12 - +91 98196 43479: It's not supposed to
06/04/2018, 07:12 - +91 98196 43479: If it contains some program memory, then your program will show errors
06/04/2018, 07:12 - +91 98196 43479: Else it will run like normal
06/04/2018, 07:13 - +91 98196 43479: Basically the extra assignment will overwrite whatever was there in those locations
06/04/2018, 07:14 - Nandini Chem: So then what it the point of even declaring an array of a given length if values are going to be overridden and prited also?
06/04/2018, 07:14 - Nandini Chem: *printed
06/04/2018, 07:21 - +91 98196 43479: Declaration reserves a set of continuous memory locations for the array
06/04/2018, 07:21 - +91 98196 43479: The locations after that can be used the computer to store program memory
06/04/2018, 07:22 - +91 98196 43479: If you overwrite those addresses, you are corrupting the program
06/04/2018, 07:22 - +91 98196 43479: That's why you need bounds
06/04/2018, 07:22 - +91 98196 43479: The compiler expects you to stick to your bounds
06/04/2018, 07:22 - +91 98196 43479: If you don't it's your fault
06/04/2018, 07:23 - +91 98409 19511: 🔥

With a bunch of teams recruiting and so many choices, it's best to talk to people and get to know what you're signing up for better. 

*Evolve* is the department responsible of bringing a new dimension to *Shaastra* every year. Year after year, we have brought bold new ideas from Shaastra's Consult wing - Shaastra Solutions to the first ever IP Moot Court by a techfest and have ensured that Shaastra continues to grow by leaps and bounds. 

We'll be having our first fundae session on *Thursday (12th April) at 6 PM, Himalaya Lawns* where we'll be sharing what we plan to do in the coming year. 

If you've already made up your mind for Evolve, awesome and if you're torn between choices, do talk to us tomorrow to get a better picture. 

Cheers,
Dheeraj and Saravana

15/04/2018, 12:10 - +91 91762 81964: Title: Computational Biology

Speaker: Manikandan Narayanan, Faculty, CSE, IITM
Venue and Timings: CS25, 12 PM

​​Abstract:​​
In this talk, I will introduce how cells process information using signaling pathways, and discuss how we may search for such signaling paths in a complex network of protein-protein interactions using randomized graph algorithms. Specifically, I will present an algorithm from the literature that randomly colors network nodes and searches for long "colorful" paths (paths with nodes that are distinctly colored). I also plan to mention some of my own research work and interests in computational biology of multi-tissue biological systems.

Speaker-Bio:​
To expand briefly, I am interested in computational network models of complex cellular behaviors, especially ones that bear relevance to local diseases. Central to my research is the development and application of computational methods involving probabilistic models or graph-theoretic algorithms, which have shown promise in my current research in revealing how networks of interacting genes rewire during neurodegenerative disease or immune states. My future research at the interface of computer science and biology would tackle new combinatorial/inference problems that arise when analyzing genomic data from two emerging areas: multi-tissue diseases and single-cell behaviors.

24/04/2018, 13:04 - +91 73505 43510: With most of you wondering about what to do in the long summer break, CFI wants you to be a part of the club you always wanted to be in with the *open-to-everyone CFI summer schools*. These offer you a chance to learn things you had wanted to but couldn't learn due to the sheer magnitude of academic work during the semester.
The summer schools program is a set of *well structured crash courses* which will guide you through learning new topics that interest you and help you try out new things on your own in a short period of time. 

With *IIT Madras placing third in Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018* held in IIT Madras,which was handled by CFI, we're aiming for the top position next year. The schools shall also act as a *training grounds* for students who want to be part of the IIT Madras contingent for the upcoming *Inter IIT Tech Meet at IIT Bombay* .

The students who feel it's too hot to stay in Chennai over the summer and those who have already booked their tickets home after the semester, shall not fear. The  bulk of the summer schools have been conveniently scheduled in the month of *July*.

For more *details regarding the schedule and content* and *for registration,*  look up on

We have math tutorial today.
25/04/2018, 10:45 - +91 95376 93006: I am forwarding your email to the HoD as he is the one who has to make the decision on this
commitment keeping everything in mind. 

As you know, one section of ME1100 is currently (and always) being offered. Thirty eight
backlog students are registered. It is being taught outside the regular hours to facilitate
students who may have clashes within the regular slot hours. The course is offered during both
semesters in an academic year. Hence there is no ground for offering it during the summer
also. In addition, faculty members have to perform a lot of administrative and academic
work during the summer. For instance : selection of MS/PhD students, recruitment of new
faculty, BTech/DD/MTech viva, MS/PhD viva voce, summer internship programs, just to name
a few. 

While I understand the students' anxiety to complete the course, I also want you to understand
that the ME dept is doing more than what can reasonably be expected from such a big 
department.

04/07/2018, 20:24 - +91 77383 46746: Joking dude
04/07/2018, 20:25 - +91 77383 46746: That report is shit
04/07/2018, 20:26 - +91 91769 39845: Thanks!
04/07/2018, 21:39 - +91 96362 19616: It might actually be.
04/07/2018, 21:40 - +91 96362 19616: Bombing a town doesn't qualify as a crime against women
04/07/2018, 21:41 - +91 98409 19511: Then what qualifies!!!
Pls tell me !
04/07/2018, 21:42 - +91 98409 19511: And explain me rationally
04/07/2018, 21:42 - +91 95376 93006: Both men and women lok
04/07/2018, 21:42 - +91 95376 93006: *lol
04/07/2018, 21:43 - +91 77383 46746: That's not the thing
04/07/2018, 21:43 - +91 77383 46746: Isis etc subject women to extreme torture
04/07/2018, 21:43 - +91 95376 93006: That is
04/07/2018, 21:43 - +91 98409 19511: Not by saying that the report is shit or something else !
If u have data then talk otherwise .....
04/07/2018, 21:43 - +91 95376 93006: This isn't
04/07/2018, 21:44 - +91 77383 46746: You expect me to get data out of Isis zones?
04/07/2018, 21:44 - +91 96362 19616: Not my opinion, but it's what these reports consider
04/07/2018, 21:45 - +91 77383 46746: The author of this report is a Palestinian
04/07/2018, 21:45 - +91 96362 19616: See that's a crime against humanity and not particularly targeted against a gender.
04/07/2018, 21:45 - +91 77383 46746: It will tend to be biased
04/07/2018, 21:45 - +91 95376 93006: WhatsApp should change this setting and add the "Except" option

04/07/2018, 22:14 - Barathwaajan: Thank you
04/07/2018, 22:15 - +91 96362 19616: Do these data only consider  the number of crimes reported? Imagine someone torchured by Isis going to a police station.
04/07/2018, 22:15 - +91 98409 19511: When did I ever mentioned gurgaon in this debate bro !
04/07/2018, 22:15 - +91 96362 19616: mention*
04/07/2018, 22:15 - +91 95376 93006: *?

04/07/2018, 22:18 - +91 95376 93006: Fir I'll spread cancer and quarrel unnecessarily with others
04/07/2018, 22:19 - +91 95376 93006: @919636219616 @917738346746 You up?
04/07/2018, 22:20 - +91 96362 19616: Arre bhai. What we're trying to say is that both these reports, the one which ranked India the most unsafe and the other one you mentioned, are not exactly right as they don't have the appropriate data sets to compare. Moreover, crime rates are not evenly distributed in any country so you can't generalize the ranking for the whole country as it could be influenced heavily by some particular region.
04/07/2018, 22:21 - +91 80543 42464: Analytics hacks 💯
04/07/2018, 22:21 - +91 96362 19616: Kuch bhi😑

04/07/2018, 22:26 - +91 94936 33847: I just wanted to see how people react when I tell them not to spam :P
04/07/2018, 22:27 - Akhil chem: 😂
04/07/2018, 22:27 - +91 96362 19616: Fine. India top. I'm sorry. End the discussion. I'll better watch some show.
04/07/2018, 22:30 - +91 95376 93006: 😢
04/07/2018, 22:38 - +91 98409 19511: SORRY GUYS , I THINK THIS GROUP IS NOT THE RIGHT PLATFORM FOR DISCUSSING A VIDEO AND IS MORE SUITED FOR SOME RANDOM DISCUSSION AND FEW COLLEGE RELATED DISCUSSIONS. I THEREBY WONT PUT ANY VIDEO OR ARTICLE WITH A INFLUENCING CONTENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CANT TOLERATE THE DISCUSSION AND THINK THAT I PROPAGATE SOME MINDSET OR SOMETHING !
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUDGING IN A VERY UNAPPRECIATED WAY AND I EXPECT THEM TO BE LITTLE FLEXIBLE IN APPROACH .

BUT DISCUSSING SOME GOOD TOPICS ( THE DATA IS AUTHENTIC) WILL DO NO HARM BUT EVEN THEN IF YOU ALL FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED THEN FINE , I WONT . 

I REALLY WANTED THE TOPIC TO BE DISCUSSED THAT ACCORDING TO THE VIDEO , RAPE IN INDIA IS DIVERSIFIED INTO MANY FIELDS AND HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIORTY IS ADMISSIBLE SECTIONS ALSO .AND SOME GENERAL AWARENESS ASPECTS ALSO. 

BUT AGAIN PEOPLE THINK THAT I WANT TO QUARREL OR SOMETHING. TO THEM I SAY SORRY PERSONALLY AND REGRET ARGUING WITH A INTELLECTUAL PERSON LIKE YOU.
04/07/2018, 22:40 - +91 95376 93006: Thank God

04/07/2018, 23:05 - +91 91678 79798: And it's more like in india women have been granted the right to complain and fight for their rights
04/07/2018, 23:06 - +91 91678 79798: Which isn't in many other countries bcoz they don't have a voice thr
04/07/2018, 23:06 - +91 91678 79798: Thus they don't registered complaints
04/07/2018, 23:13 - +91 95376 93006: *register

04/07/2018, 23:15 - +91 91678 79798: And u had to support him
04/07/2018, 23:35 - +91 97310 90474: For a moment i thought there was intellectual banter on this group 🙃
04/07/2018, 23:35 - +91 96868 79446: Ohh legendary trash talker
04/07/2018, 23:35 - +91 97310 90474: Hmmm watchya say?...
04/07/2018, 23:37 - +91 97310 90474: Lol chill. Thode smart log hai disc ke liye 🌚
05/07/2018, 00:49 - +91 98409 19511: Yep bro !
Giving apologies is trash talking then I won’t be wrong judging that person!
05/07/2018, 00:50 - +91 98409 19511: Not just trash talking , but legendary trash talking !
05/07/2018, 00:52 - +91 95376 93006: Dude half of your information is based on half knowledge. Its like 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
05/07/2018, 00:53 - +91 98409 19511: Oh I didn’t know that !!
05/07/2018, 00:53 - +91 98409 19511: Thanks by the way !
05/07/2018, 00:54 - +91 95376 93006: First get every fact correct. Then come have a debate. We'd be happy to learn something or even counter some views. Until then keep your illiterate narcissistic ideas to yourself
05/07/2018, 00:55 - +91 98409 19511: Ohkay sorry , I won’t do that again
05/07/2018, 00:55 - +91 98409 19511: Sorry again
05/07/2018, 00:57 - +91 98409 19511: From next time I will assume that u know the facts correctly and I will ask u only
05/07/2018, 00:58 - +91 98409 19511: Because u can judge a person’s factuality level with a chat
05/07/2018, 00:58 - Akhil chem: Yes...we would learn a lot from him indeed.. great idea
05/07/2018, 00:58 - Akhil chem: Yes.. definitely 😂
05/07/2018, 01:01 - +91 95376 93006: No but next time onwards when people are telling you stuff, stop for a moment and think if they have a point or not. Today Raj and Sriram had a point but you were more into proving your point.
05/07/2018, 01:02 - +91 98409 19511: Ok sir I will for sure
05/07/2018, 01:02 - +91 95376 93006: Your point may or may not be correct. That's not the issue. The issue is that when someone mentions something which does make sense, you don't even listen
05/07/2018, 01:02 - +91 98409 19511: Oh
05/07/2018, 01:02 - +91 98409 19511: Fine next time I will
05/07/2018, 01:03 - +91 98409 19511: Anything else sir
05/07/2018, 01:03 - Akhil chem: Yes we should listen to the smart ppl
...ok Aryan..be a good boy 😂
05/07/2018, 01:04 - +91 95376 93006: Great. One more salty person to deal with. What a time to be online
05/07/2018, 01:04 - +91 98409 19511: Haan haan , Abb se Shaunak bhaiya ki baat sar ankho par !!

05/07/2018, 01:05 - +91 95376 93006: *Shounak
05/07/2018, 01:05 - Akhil chem: He better be the auto correct..things would have been so better
05/07/2018, 01:06 - +91 98409 19511: sorry again for my Misconduct!
Don’t term me as illiterate narcissistic
05/07/2018, 01:06 - +91 95376 93006: Yeah. Atleast you wouldn't have failed in English o level
05/07/2018, 01:06 - +91 98409 19511: I failed bhaiya
05/07/2018, 01:06 - Akhil chem: Hmm... So true
05/07/2018, 01:07 - +91 98409 19511: Aur kuch ??
05/07/2018, 01:07 - +91 98409 19511: By the way , which newspaper do u read or which article from which I get all this gyaan bhaiya ??
05/07/2018, 01:08 - Akhil chem: He is actually big..we should call him bhaiya..I heard u took a drop
05/07/2018, 01:09 - +91 95376 93006: Also I don't want to know if you're sarcastic or not, which you are of course. You should check all sources before citing them. Most newspapers report with changes. There was an article on 2 AIs discovering a different language to communicate which was covered wrongly by the newspapers. Do cross check your views
05/07/2018, 01:10 - +91 98409 19511: Ohkay , so tell me ur source na , how can u be so sure abt the views
05/07/2018, 01:10 - +91 95376 93006: Because I read all sources about tricky issues
05/07/2018, 01:11 - +91 95376 93006: CNN, BBC, local news channels
05/07/2018, 01:11 - +91 98409 19511: Oh
05/07/2018, 01:11 - Akhil chem: Jobless
05/07/2018, 01:11 - +91 98409 19511: Which shows
05/07/2018, 01:11 - +91 95376 93006: You can never be sure which newspaper or sites to trust
05/07/2018, 01:11 - +91 98409 19511: The question is which I trust

05/07/2018, 01:12 - +91 98409 19511: ??

05/07/2018, 01:12 - +91 98409 19511: ??
05/07/2018, 01:12 - +91 98409 19511: ??
05/07/2018, 01:12 - +91 95376 93006: What?

05/07/2018, 01:13 - +91 95376 93006: .
05/07/2018, 01:13 - +91 95376 93006: Can't help if you misread
05/07/2018, 01:13 - +91 98409 19511: BBC has very less coverage area in India
05/07/2018, 01:14 - +91 95376 93006: But it has the video of an outsider
05/07/2018, 01:14 - +91 98409 19511: And as far as I know it takes few data from DD channel
05/07/2018, 01:14 - +91 95376 93006: To form a decision you need to check all sides
05/07/2018, 01:14 - +91 98409 19511: Cnn and bbc are both same category bhaiya
05/07/2018, 01:14 - +91 95376 93006: Everyone takes some data from everyone. But they are biased against something or someone
05/07/2018, 01:15 - +91 95376 93006: BBC and CNN are biased against Middle East. So you need to know the local story
05/07/2018, 01:15 - +91 98409 19511: Ohkay so how were u so sure abt my illiterate narcissistic views ??
05/07/2018, 01:15 - +91 95376 93006: Did you even listen to what Raj and Sriram wrote?
05/07/2018, 01:15 - +91 95376 93006: *read what
05/07/2018, 01:16 - +91 98409 19511: Yes
05/07/2018, 01:16 - +91 95376 93006: Do you think they have a point?
05/07/2018, 01:17 - +91 98409 19511: That u will decide !
05/07/2018, 01:17 - +91 95376 93006: I'm not one to decide, you are
05/07/2018, 01:17 - +91 98409 19511: U were the one who told that I have a illiterate narcissistic view
05/07/2018, 01:17 - +91 95376 93006: Also this is why I called you narcissistic
05/07/2018, 01:18 - +91 95376 93006: Illiterate was an additional insult.
05/07/2018, 01:18 - +91 98409 19511: U only decide who has point and who doesn’t
05/07/2018, 01:18 - +91 95376 93006: I never said anything about you not having a point
05/07/2018, 01:18 - +91 95376 93006: Did I?
05/07/2018, 01:18 - +91 95376 93006: You're the one assuming that
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 98409 19511: What is this then ?
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 95376 93006: I do think you have a point but they do too. The views on such matters are multifaceted. There are a lot of statistics and issues. You can generalie things
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 95376 93006: "Every"
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 98409 19511: U have already declared me the one with wrong facts
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 95376 93006: *can't generalize
05/07/2018, 01:20 - +91 95376 93006: I haven't
05/07/2018, 01:21 - +91 95376 93006: I told you some of what you said are wrong
05/07/2018, 01:21 - +91 95376 93006: They are generalized
05/07/2018, 01:21 - +91 98409 19511: I am the who has stats in form of video and report and I , raj and sriram didnt show any fact even till now
05/07/2018, 01:21 - +91 98409 19511: U are only talking English with no stats
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 95376 93006: So where is the video from?
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 98409 19511: Do u have any credible stats to counter mine ??
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 98409 19511: Give me the counter stats
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 98409 19511: Then we will discuss
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 95376 93006: I'm not countering you. I'm merely telling you they are right.
05/07/2018, 01:22 - +91 95376 93006: I'll give an example. You'll understand
05/07/2018, 01:23 - +91 98409 19511: No example

05/07/2018, 01:23 - +91 95376 93006: Again this. I told you some of them are wrong

05/07/2018, 01:24 - +91 95376 93006: It's all logicsl
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 98409 19511: Prove to me that my stats and facts are wrong
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 95376 93006: *logical
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 95376 93006: Fine. Don't accept it.
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 98409 19511: U only have logic Kya
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 95376 93006: It's pretty true
05/07/2018, 01:25 - +91 98409 19511: Then there is no point discussing
05/07/2018, 01:26 - +91 95376 93006: Alright
05/07/2018, 01:26 - +91 98409 19511: And yeah next time , be polite and don’t cross the limits . I have been polite always in this debate
05/07/2018, 01:27 - +91 95376 93006: Is that a threat?
05/07/2018, 01:27 - +91 95376 93006: Or a warning?
05/07/2018, 01:27 - +91 95376 93006: Because I don't care
05/07/2018, 01:27 - +91 98409 19511: Yeah , a threat to a person who says i am illiterate
05/07/2018, 01:28 - +91 98409 19511: I guess I can also speak that filthy language of urs , but I choose to refrain ! My upbringing has taught me that !
05/07/2018, 01:29 - +91 95376 93006: Let's not talk about your upbringing here. People here don't like obscenities
05/07/2018, 01:33 - +91 98409 19511: By the way tell my wrong stats ??
05/07/2018, 01:33 - +91 95376 93006: @919636219616 @917738346746
05/07/2018, 01:34 - +91 98409 19511: They didn’t give stats and facts
05/07/2018, 01:34 - +91 95376 93006: I tagged them
05/07/2018, 01:34 - +91 98409 19511: They only have words
05/07/2018, 01:34 - +91 95376 93006: I didn't tell they are my sources
05/07/2018, 01:34 - +91 98409 19511: But I said that my stats were wrong , how come ??
05/07/2018, 01:35 - +91 98409 19511: U must be knowing my wrong facts
05/07/2018, 01:35 - +91 98409 19511: Pls share my wrong facts
05/07/2018, 01:35 - +91 98409 19511: Because u were the one who said my facts are wrong
05/07/2018, 01:35 - +91 95376 93006: I do. But you won't listen to my logic.
05/07/2018, 01:35 - +91 98409 19511: No logic , stats and facts
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 95376 93006: And you were the one who said there's no point in discussing it with me
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 98409 19511: Logic can given my many
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 98409 19511: But facts only by few
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 98409 19511: So I agreed that I don’t know my wrong facts
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 98409 19511: And pls don’t change the topic
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 95376 93006: I am noy
05/07/2018, 01:36 - +91 95376 93006: *not
05/07/2018, 01:37 - +91 95376 93006: You aren't listening to me
05/07/2018, 01:37 - +91 98409 19511: U have facts to counter my facts
05/07/2018, 01:37 - +91 98409 19511: ??
05/07/2018, 01:37 - +91 95376 93006: Yes. But I don't want to further continue talking on this
05/07/2018, 01:37 - +91 98409 19511: If not then logic is not enough to say someone illiterate narcissistic
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 95376 93006: That's why I tagged them
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 95376 93006: Hopefully they have the patience to deal with you
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 98409 19511: Why !!!
U termed me as illiterate!
So pls justify it with countering facts
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 95376 93006: I don't
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 98409 19511: U don’t have patience or facts ??
05/07/2018, 01:38 - +91 95376 93006: Patience
05/07/2018, 01:39 - +91 98409 19511: The truth is that u don’t have facts as well as patience and that is why u as well as others didn’t provide any facts and figure to prove me wrong
05/07/2018, 01:39 - +91 98409 19511: Ppl only let their emotional views out !
05/07/2018, 01:40 - +91 95376 93006: Implying things doesn't make them true
05/07/2018, 01:40 - +91 95376 93006: That's what you're doing and have been doing till now
05/07/2018, 01:40 - +91 98409 19511: U only started implying me as illiterate

08/07/2018, 19:13 - +91 94936 33847: Does anyone know what I have to do if I don't get an HS elective allotted to me?
08/07/2018, 19:13 - +91 98196 43479: Wait for second round
08/07/2018, 19:14 - +91 94936 33847: Didn't even get french and German 🤧🤧
08/07/2018, 19:18 - +91 95376 93006: Ahh damn. I got Eco
08/07/2018, 19:19 - +91 96868 79446: Gg
08/07/2018, 19:19 - +91 70139 26978: Wait for the second round
08/07/2018, 19:19 - +91 96868 79446: Eco is a good course
08/07/2018, 19:19 - +91 95376 93006: I know. Damn was for him xP
08/07/2018, 19:19 - +91 96868 79446: Ohh ok😅😅😅
08/07/2018, 19:41 - +91 91769 39845: Cg cutoff
08/07/2018, 19:41 - +91 94936 33847: Ooh
08/07/2018, 19:41 - +91 96868 79446: I don't think there's anything like this
08/07/2018, 19:42 - +91 96868 79446: And amogh has a good CG only na
08/07/2018, 19:42 - +91 94936 33847: I thought HS was random
08/07/2018, 19:42 - +91 91769 39845: No, there is, for French and German
08/07/2018, 19:42 - +91 91769 39845: This is stratified random
08/07/2018, 19:43 - +91 94936 33847: Ooh beyond a certain cut off only some people get allotted randomly ah?
08/07/2018, 19:45 - +91 91769 39845: No. Stratified random implies that allotment is random only among those students whose preference is the same. Students with a higher preference get a higher priority
08/07/2018, 19:45 - +91 94936 33847: Cool cool. I put them below eco courses
08/07/2018, 19:46 - +91 94936 33847: They're all filled to capacity now.
08/07/2018, 19:46 - +91 91769 39845: You'll mostly get it in round 2
08/07/2018, 19:47 - +91 94936 33847: Does anyone know peaceful HS courses other than languages and eco?
08/07/2018, 19:47 - +91 94936 33847: Will people drop out or something?
08/07/2018, 19:48 - +91 91769 39845: The capacity might be increased
08/07/2018, 19:48 - +91 94936 33847: Right.
08/07/2018, 20:23 - Barathwaajan: @919176939845 How does math elective allotment work?

08/07/2018, 20:47 - +91 77383 46746: Stratified random. That means, it doesn't depend on CG. Among all those who have put it as the first option, random selection will be made according to availability
08/07/2018, 20:47 - +91 77383 46746: Similarly among all those who have put it as second option and so on

17/08/2018, 22:21 - Rano Chem: Friends,

Kerala is going through extreme havocs due to downpour & flood and the death tolls have already reached above 150. This is the deadliest flood reported in the state since a century. Though many people are rescued, there are still a number missing and abandoned. Those rescued amounting to more than a lakh are sheltered on various relief camps across state. They are in short of food, water, clothes, sanitary napkins and other daily-use-materials. This is the time for us to step in and show our spirit to help Kerala overcome the sorrow. 

We can  contribute by collecting materials (list given below) and send to our friends and family in Kerala through the collection drive being organised by the Institute Disaster Management Cell.

* Blankets
* Mats
* Sweaters and woolen clothes
* Sanitary Napkins
* Salt, rice, rava, bread, rusks and ready to eat items
* New undergarments and dresses
* Cooking Utensils
* Buckets and Mugs
* Candles
* Toilet items like soap, paste, brushes, antiseptic liquids, mosquito repellents etc.
	
We have kept *a box infront of entrance of all hostels* and who ever who are willing to donate any of the above mentioned items can do so
17/08/2018, 22:21 - Rano Chem: Those who wish to contribute as cash can do so by donating it directly to the Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF):

17/08/2018, 23:34 - Barathwaajan: Pliss to use this
17/08/2018, 23:35 - +91 80891 23999: Aahaa...Is it so ??
17/08/2018, 23:35 - Akhil chem: Haan
17/08/2018, 23:35 - +91 77383 46746: I think what we should take away from this video is that we should help those people
17/08/2018, 23:36 - Barathwaajan: +100
17/08/2018, 23:36 - Jeswin: Is that all? Do u even understand how emotionless the centre were until now? All the time in the world and they come off now!
17/08/2018, 23:36 - +91 80891 23999: True that
17/08/2018, 23:36 - +91 77383 46746: The video might be propaganda but at the end of the day, there is a lot of problem
17/08/2018, 23:36 - Akhil chem: Bro😂😂..if u can spam typing one one alphabet of jalabulagang..then this is quite reasonable and informative if talking is done in a proper way
17/08/2018, 23:36 - Akhil chem: Haan
17/08/2018, 23:37 - Barathwaajan: I never did the Jala bula Jung thing here
17/08/2018, 23:37 - Akhil chem: Achha.. @919493633847 ?..can u please clarify
17/08/2018, 23:38 - Akhil chem: That's the biggest lie u ever told 😂😂
17/08/2018, 23:38 - +91 80891 23999: And that's how you fly an aircraft with zero knowledge, Good PR bro
17/08/2018, 23:40 - +91 77383 46746: What do you mean? I want to emphasize on the problem in Kerala. I ma just of the opinion that this 'MIGHT' be propaganda
17/08/2018, 23:40 - +91 77383 46746: *am
17/08/2018, 23:42 - +91 98409 19511: I am speechless !!!! ....... I am talking abt Indian army not Indian govt . Two Indian govt can do :::
1..Give money for relief fund ... and just like in other states this money will be misused ( eg jammu flood . 1000 CR ALLOCATED and Supreme Court said that money was not used properly ! )
2.. put army navy and Air Force into immediate effect . 
Govt did the second thing and army is doing a lot. It’s ur problem that u can’t see our army’s effort !!!
17/08/2018, 23:47 - +91 80891 23999: I am wordless !!! ....... I am writing of the flawlessness of GOI, and two minutes of silence to the effort the GOI has put in to bright up the relief operations and that of allocating 100Cr fund (Out of the required 1000Cr fund). Nice to see happy faces and the state not needing donations from people. Thanks to the support of GOI  #ReSPECT GOI
17/08/2018, 23:49 - +91 80891 23999: To be very specific 100Cr relief fund is less than 10% of the immediate fund need, Why so? Simply South
17/08/2018, 23:50 - Jeswin: And that too while highlighting the work GoI has done to send in army and navy, a hell lot late than it should have been.
17/08/2018, 23:51 - +91 80891 23999: Sry, I felt this 'Might' sharper than 'emphasize'
17/08/2018, 23:53 - +91 80891 23999: Disclaimer : Never to degrade the effort put up by the army, navy and other security forces. Whole of my point is on the double standard play of GoI which all those army and navy are subjected to follow
17/08/2018, 23:53 - Jeswin: +1
17/08/2018, 23:54 - +91 98409 19511: Here in south India , things always get north vs south !!! 
I am really fed up !!! 
Praise ur CM and local governments and be happy !!!
17/08/2018, 23:54 - Rano Chem: Ok. Since everyone is so enthusiastic about everything, I just want to inform that there will be transport of goods collected, to kerala around 3 pm tomorrow. So please try to contribute before that. There are lot of volunteers assigned to help with various dropboxes, and they will help you however they can.
Narmada hostel has already contributed around 3 cartons to the cause. So, if anyone is up for a competition, we can have that also ;)
PS. Avoid contributing used clothes. This is for hygiene purpose.
17/08/2018, 23:55 - +91 98409 19511: Kerala govt is best !!
17/08/2018, 23:55 - +91 77383 46746: 👍
17/08/2018, 23:56 - +91 77383 46746: I do agree with Aryan that it always becomes state vs centre where there is a non centre government

18/08/2018, 00:28 - +91 98409 19511: <Media omitted>
18/08/2018, 00:29 - +91 98409 19511: People don’t roam around with wrong info .. central had alloted 320 cr and additional 100 cr to disaster relief fund
18/08/2018, 00:33 - +91 98409 19511: Army reaching Kerala takes time as majority of army personnel are in international border area for security but even before that army was in the state of Kerala even before Kerala govt declared red alert in its 13 districts !!!!!

Look I am not criticising Kerala govt and I won’t tolerate baseless propaganda! 

First ppl should have proper knowledge of what they are talking !
18/08/2018, 00:34 - Jeswin: Wrong info tere pass hai bhai.

18/08/2018, 00:35 - Jeswin: Oh really. How come just you knew abt it and none of Kerala's media?!
18/08/2018, 00:36 - +91 98409 19511: It’s written in the article which is run by an independent media house ( a system followed in democratic governance )
18/08/2018, 00:37 - +91 98409 19511: Kerala already had 348 cr in its relief funds from central govt before the disaster and then govt added 320 cr last week and then 100 cr now !!!
18/08/2018, 00:39 - Jeswin: So you are practically saying govt gave some 750 cr. Just FYI, none, except for some sort of "independent media house" as u said knew abt it. Is that a coincidence.. or a controversy
18/08/2018, 00:40 - +91 98409 19511: What !! Read the article and see the details !  You will the disaster management funds allocated
18/08/2018, 00:40 - Rahul Humayun: Why don't you guys keep this in pm instead of blowing up our phones. Let's just stick with doing our bit to help with the horrific situation in Kerala. Political debates later.
18/08/2018, 00:40 - +91 97310 90474: *Pandey ji strikes again*
18/08/2018, 00:40 - Jeswin: Yeah u practically say that every thing except this one's all lies

18/08/2018, 00:44 - +91 98409 19511: Article is by Hindustan times , which has majority of its printing press in south India and it is biased !

18/08/2018, 03:51 - +91 97310 90474: There nothing wrong wtf
18/08/2018, 07:28 - Rano Chem: Just to clarify, centre has currently allocated more than 300 crore for relief, but it is inadequate against over 10000 cr. worth damage that has occurred till now. 
The army, navy and air force have been helping from the start, and is still sending more units everyday.
There are many locations where people are stranded and water is steadily rising, which is only accessible by air. The current number of boats and aircrafts deployed are not enough for the current relief operation, failing of which, could result in a lot of additional deaths.
That is where we need national coverage, and that is what people in kerala, are asking for. 
Since all officials are on relief operations, the part we can do is help those in the relief camps. and that is where we need your help.
18/08/2018, 07:29 - Rano Chem: <Media omitted>
18/08/2018, 07:29 - Rano Chem: .
18/08/2018, 07:55 - Rano Chem: For those who are wondering why we aren't collecting money and using some ngo help, it is because the dean is not allowing us to, citing some iitm rules that no insti organization is allowed to collect money from individuals. So if anyone can interfere with that, please do. It would have been lot easier and effective.
18/08/2018, 15:28 - +91 87240 03210: Any update?

27/09/2018, 14:47 - +91 80783 39823: I mean if I don't know the name,how will I enter his marks in the sheet.....so it would be considered he was absent....... Earlier tutorials also,some people didn't write their name and didn't approach ma'am or me ,so their marks have not been entered....This is happening in more or less every tutorial,and it is such a basic thing to write your name, when u get your question paper and it is creating problem for me...

DMC has planned for Flood relief collection drive for Gaja cyclone affected areas. 

We *need volunteers to help* with arrangements for the same.

If you *are available from 21st - 25th Nov*, kindly join us.  

Please join the group here : https://chat.whatsapp.com/LENHJ7icTiNFaU7WBekVoi
21/11/2018, 10:55 - Nikhil navnath: Dear Insti Junta, 

TN needs your help. Cyclone Gaja devastated the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. 2.5 lakh people are living in temporary camps. Nearly 30000 electric posts are damaged. It completely vanquished the crops, trees and livestock. Many remote areas are completely cut off from the access points. 

Please do donate generously!

CH2014 Fundamentals of Heat & Mass Transfer
Objectives:
This course will enable students to understand the basic concepts and principles of Heat and Mass Transfer. The course will highlight the analogies in the molecular and convective transport of heat and mass, thereby providing a unifying framework for appreciating transport phenomena principles. It also develops the necessary background that will prepare the student to apply the heat and mass transfer concepts in the design of industrial heat exchanger and separation processes equipment.

Course Contents:
1. Illustrations of conductive and convective transport: Shell balance approach illustrating Fourier’s and Fick’s laws, Mass transfer in a falling film, Solid dissolution, Conduction in composite rectangular and cylindrical solids, Critical thickness of insulation, Heat transfer in fins, Mass transfer and chemical reaction

2. Concept of transport coefficients: Concept of equilibrium, Concept of film transfer coefficients, Overall transfer coefficients, F and k type of mass transfer coefficients, Analogy between heat and mass transfer

3. Prediction of Convective Heat and Mass Transfer Coefficients – Dimensional Analysis, standard correlations in natural and forced convection, Thermal and concentration boundary layer theories

4. Turbulent heat and mass transfer

5. Principles of Discrete and Differential Separations: Equilibrium stage, Cocurrent, crosscurrent and countercurrent staged operation, Kremser’s Equations

6. Introduction Boiling and Condensation: Pool and flow boiling, Filmwise and dropwise condensation

I am *Raj Jain*. I'm standing for the post of *Department Legislator (Academic)*, formerly Branch Councillor.
I'd love to hear what you have to say about the issues our department is facing- be it in academics, projects, interns, senior-junior bonding etc. so I can take proactive measures to address them. I wish for everyone in the department to feel that they are as much a part of the SLC and the Department Consultative Committee as the legislator is.

Help me out by taking out a minute to fill this *tiny little form!*

27/02/2019, 22:26 - +91 95376 93006: Hello,


Diffusion and Fick's law are deceptively simple.  Be careful in defining the appropriate form of Fick's law.  Mass fraction gradient drives diffusion while density gradient caused by temperature differences drive natural convection and the latter is not described by Fick's law.  So mass fraction gradient is more fundamental.  

Also volume averaged velocity is better than mass/molar average velocity.  This is based on partial molar properties (V_1Bar * N_1+V_2bar*N_2) and explicitly defined on concentration gradient.    

We cannot always assume constant total concentration and take rho_t or C_t within the gradient in Fick's law based on mass fraction or mole fraction driving forces.   

So exercise Fick's law with caution.


In the fundamental form, Fick's diffusion coefficients based on mass averaged velocity (and mass fraction gradient), molar averaged velocity (and mole fraction gradient) and volume averaged velocity based on concentration gradient are all the same.  But diffusion coefficient based on density gradient and mass averaged velocity is not the same as the previous three !


We live in confusing times - be careful with definitions.

12/03/2019, 01:07 - +91 95376 93006: Before Concepts test I would like you all to read papers in literature on the following topics having relevant heat and mass transfer topics

Solid Dissolution (spinning disk of benzoic acid)

Taylor Vortices


Thermal food sterilization


Flow down a falling film


LMTD in heat exchangers


etc.


You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19


Format of the 1 page summary


Concept studied:


Mis-concept that you may have had:


How the mis-concept was clarified and your concept got strengthened




Happy Reading

Leveque solution gives local Sh for high Graetz number viz. Pe/(x/D)



Hausen correlation  gives average Sh


Let us integrate Leveque solution for kc_local and then see if the average Sh based on this matches with correlation.


See scanned notes attached


Match is good.  Correlation is an approximate expression given for our convenience.  Hence exact match does not occur but the values are close enough

23/03/2019, 17:18 - +91 95376 93006: So many students have asked me this doubt hence I confirmed this from the HOD and got back to you guys.
*You need to compulsorily complete an eight weeks industrial internship by the end of your degree.* So BTechs who are planning to do a research intern should definitely do an industrial intern this summer for a min of 8 weeks.
Now for others, it is advisable to do an industrial internship but you can choose any of your internship: either second year summer or third year summer to be converted into the compulsory industrial intern. 
Also, the internship need not be core. However, if it is non core, you need a letter of approval from one of the *systems engineering profs* of our dept to agree that you are indeed doing something close to systems engineering in that non core internship.
The systems engineering profs are:
1. Arun K Tangirala
2. Sreedhar Kumar Narasimhan
3. Shankar Narasimhan
4. Raghunathan Rengaswamy 
5. Niket Kaisare

24/03/2019, 21:57 - +91 95376 93006: So I'll clarify. The paper you chose has to uploaded here. And the summary has to submitted in class
24/03/2019, 21:57 - +91 95376 93006: You may work in groups of 3, send the paper you reviewed and summarize in one page the mass/heat transfer concepts that you learnt.  One good way to choose a paper is to focus on what you are not sure about and then search for the paper on the concept that was bothering you.


You may not understand the entire paper but at least be aware of the concepts involved.


The summary of concepts that you have learnt should not exceed 1 page.  


Papers selected must be uploaded in google drive for everyone to download - do not send them to me.  However send me the link.

This will be evaluated.  I will evaluate the 1 page summary after seeing the paper your group has selected.  Marks will be also  given for relevance to the subject taught so far.


After this, I will hold the concepts test as I am not sure what concepts you are not clear about.  Deadline for submission is next Wednesday i.e. 20.3.19

28/03/2019, 09:00 - +91 70139 26978: My comment to the discussion on the paper attached and highlighted above is as follows

These are well known.  What about cases involving very low Pr numbers i.e. liquid metals where thermal boundary layer will grow faster than hydrodynamic boundary layer.  However, the thermal boundary layer may not get fully developed until and unless the velocity boundary layer gets eventually fully developed.  So we have a situation where despite thermal diffusivity being higher than momentum diffusivity, entrance length for hydrodynamic boundary layer may be shorter than thermal boundary layer in contrast with other cases.  However, the two entry lengths may not be too different as the moment the velocity boundary layer is established, the thermal boundary layer will be established as well owing to very high thermal diffusivity.  So perhaps this case does fit into the case of low Pr numbers discussed by authors above.  When fluid properties take effect, things become more complicated.  

Ozisik seems to agree with this assessment as he says that when Pr is low, (nu < alfa), thermal entrance length is higher than hydrodynamic entrance length and is a weak function of Pr until Pr is about 0.07.  So when Pr is < 0.07 (liquid metals), entrance length is stil longer than hydrodynamic entrance length but no longer dependent on Pr.

Fill this form or read below and fill this form.

Can you introspect on how much is it that you on an average spend per week ordering meal online? Rupees 300, 500, 1000, or more than that. Well, you know your number! Or worse, just skipped the meal. 

Now, what I want you to ponder on is how many among these times you had to order/skip because 

*a)*	Waking up on an alarm was only possible if someone told me it was ringing. Duh!
*b)*	You missed the MESS meal because your favourite show made you lose track of time
*c)*	Walking to the MESS was just like losing your arm and leg
*d)*	Succumbing to the peer pressure as none of my friends were going
*e)*	I had my classes/lab and couldn’t risk the W.
*f)* Food is not good.

13/04/2019, 21:37 - +91 95376 93006: What is interfacial tension?


Similar to surface tension - for gas-liquid systems


It applies for liquid-liquid systems (e.g. water-kerosene)


It is a measure of the energy required to create new surface.  For big drops in liquid  if interfacial tension is high then they tend

to remain big because of high energy requirement to break them into small drops.  Hence agitation leading to eddies formation is required to break them into smaller drops.  We need smaller drops because they have more interfacial area per unit volume.  

However, if interfacial tension is less, then drops break easily and tend to cause emulsions.   

Drops may exhibit interfacial turbulence exhibiting  Marangoni phenomena that include

a.  Ripples

b.  eruptions

c. offshoot of mass

d. violent and erratic pulsations of the drop
d.  spontaneous emulsification

These cause higher than expected mass transfer.  


Causes


a.  composition variation along the interface from mass transfer
b.  temperature variation along the interface from heat transfer


These lead to interfacial tension gradients since interfacial tension is a temperature and composition dependent property.


Also deviations from equilibrium shape of the drop due to extension and contraction of the interface tends to create these interfacial disturbances.


Moral:  


Simple additive resistances from inverse of mass transfer coefficients and m is only a first estimate of overall resistance.


Keeping silence in class will enable better understanding

27/04/2019, 22:49 - +91 95376 93006: In turbulent flow correlation  Re = L*v*rho/mu

If L is increased 2 times, v is decreased two times, Re is unaffected and so is Nu.  However if the flow regime changes if v is decreased from 100 m/s to 50 m/s turbulent flow correlation does not apply even if Re is not affected.  

In flow past immersed bodies, (unlike in tubes where velocity and diameter are interlinked), when characteristic dimension of the body is increased and velocity decreased and flow regime may change i.e. become  laminar from turbulent in which case the same correlation may not apply.
28/04/2019, 02:48 - +91 95376 93006: Please make the correction to 0.943 (=4/3 times the local value) for falling film laminar vertical plate film condensation for average heat transfer coefficient (h^bar)

 laminar film condensation in for horizontal tube​ the pre-constant for average (h^bar) is 0.725.

22/10/2019, 15:09 - +91 96001 48759: Wrong
22/10/2019, 15:39 - +91 90109 15098: 🤣
22/10/2019, 20:23 - +91 95376 93006: If the CRE asks whether to keep the end sems open notes or closed notes, we're going for closed notes. Easier paper
22/10/2019, 20:23 - +91 91678 79798: No
22/10/2019, 20:24 - +91 95376 93006: You know it's absolute grading, right?
22/10/2019, 20:25 - +91 97310 90474: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:27 - +91 98409 24551: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:28 - Praveen hindi chem: Yes
22/10/2019, 20:29 - +91 96501 91968: How sure are we about this? What if he screws us over?
22/10/2019, 20:29 - +91 96501 91968: He is someone who is capable of that
22/10/2019, 20:37 - +91 95376 93006: It'll def be easier than open notes
22/10/2019, 20:38 - +91 91678 79798: U found quiz 1 tougher?
22/10/2019, 20:38 - +91 91678 79798: Both the papers were very similar in terms of easy hard
22/10/2019, 20:39 - Akhil chem: +1.. So were my pathetic marks 🥺
22/10/2019, 20:40 - +91 98409 19511: Sameeee
22/10/2019, 20:49 - +91 95376 93006: Because the content wasn't a lot
22/10/2019, 20:50 - +91 95376 93006: I don't even understand why we're having a discussion on this. Closed notes means easier paper than open notes, regardless of whether he screws us or not. And it's better to go for an easier paper if it is absolute grading
22/10/2019, 20:57 - +91 94936 33847: Yeah
22/10/2019, 20:58 - Rahul Humayun: Yee

22/10/2019, 20:58 - +91 77383 46746: Either way it doesn't matter I guess. I guess closed notes are better
22/10/2019, 20:59 - Nandini Chem: Go for closed notes
22/10/2019, 20:59 - Keerthan: Yes
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: dude the paper will be the way he wants
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: he wont give a fuck paper whether open or closed
22/10/2019, 21:01 - +91 91678 79798: fuck whether paper is open or closed*
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: So it doesn't matter for you
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: Right?
22/10/2019, 21:02 - +91 95376 93006: Because he doesn't give a fuck

04/11/2019, 21:29 - +91 95376 93006: He didn't confirm yet. But it's happening mostly. They only wanted to know the issues it would create and I don't think that us wanting to keep our final semester free of compulsory courses is a reason they'd accept. So...
04/11/2019, 21:30 - +91 77383 46746: But isn't it wiser to change it later? Many wouldn't have planned their courses out for the next 3 sems
