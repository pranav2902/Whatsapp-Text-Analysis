04/12/2019, 16:59 - Mahesh Jayasankar: Also as a secondary utility we could rank the most used emojis; this is my favourite one 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
04/12/2019, 16:59 - Mahesh Jayasankar: I'll end all my sentences with that 👌🏽
04/12/2019, 17:00 - Mahesh Jayasankar: So make sure to use 👍🏽 emojis 😏😏 frequently 👌🏽
04/12/2019, 17:00 - Mahesh Jayasankar: Maybe insert a few as noise in your text 👌🏽

04/12/2019, 18:37 - Pranav Kamesh: Is the emoji in the title affecting the text file
04/12/2019, 18:37 - Mahesh Jayasankar: No I just realised if we are to use scripts, then we may need to have the group title as something typable👌🏽
04/12/2019, 18:38 - Mahesh Jayasankar: And the number sequence just because 👌🏽
04/12/2019, 18:39 - Pranav Kamesh: Yeah cool ✌

04/12/2019, 18:49 - Mahesh Jayasankar: ... On second thoughts it's against WhatsApp TOS to automate message-sending. I don't wanna get banned and neither do you 😅. We'll stick to brute messaging👌🏽
